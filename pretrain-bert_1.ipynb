Giuseppe Mancia, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Management of Hypertensive Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea SyndromeOne of the key features defining any type of secondary hypertension is the observation that by treating the underlying condition, an improvement in BP is achieved. Currently the treatment of choice in OSAS is the nocturnal application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).1,2 This provides an increase of pressure in the airways during both inspiration and expiration, thereby preventing the collapse of upper airways and the occurrence of OSAS. This leads to a reduction in the frequency of apneas and to a disappearance of apnea-related BP and HR peaks, suggesting that regular CPAP might at least in part reverse the adverse changes in CV regulation caused by OSAS. A reduction in the pressor response to apneas can be seen on the first night after CPAP suspension (Fig. 11-7).Clinical studies have assessed the possible association between the application of CPAP in OSAS and a prolonged arterial BP reduction.31,32 Unfortunately, many have methodologic problems, most importantly the lack of proper control groups and inadequate BP measurement techniques.Observational data suggest that treatment of severe OSAS may be beneficial for CV risk reduction. When compared with OSAS-free subjects, those with severe OSAS but no CPAP displayed a threefold higher risk of CV events, both fatal and nonfatal, even after adjustment for major risk factors. No excess risk was seen in subjects who received CPAP treatment, but this was also the case in a subgroup of subjects with mild and moderate OSAS and no CPAP treatment.24Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled studies (Fig. 11-8) have confirmed some of the uncertainties of the past.32-35In summary, some points can be supported by clinical studies. (1) In hypertensive OSAS patients, effective CPAP treatment causes substantial reduction in 24-hour BP, although many patients still require antihypertensive medication; (2) In patients without hypertension or with well-controlled hypertension, CPAP will lower nocturnal BP, with minimal or no reduction in daytime BP; (3) The effect of CPAP on lowering BP increases with OSAS severity; and (4) CPAP might not lower BP in nonsleepy OSAS patients, although some small changes may appear if a sufficiently long follow-up time is considered. The relatively small change in BP reported by studies after CPAP treatment may depend on additional factors that affect BP values, such as vascular remodeling in long-standing hypertension, genetic predisposition, or comorbidities (e.g., DM and obesity).The mechanisms underlying the BP-lowering effect of CPAP have been investigated in many studies, most of them focusing on changes in autonomic CV control. CPAP reduced sympathetic and increased parasympathetic activity, increased stroke volume and cardiac output, and decreased systemic vascular resistance. These changes can be mediated by an increase in baroreflex sensitivity as well as by changes in some nonneural mechanisms. An improvement in baroreflex sensitivity by long-lasting CPAP treatment was shown by spontaneous baroreflex analysis, which allows the sensitivity of arterial baroreflex control of HR to be assessed through computer analysis of interactions between spontaneous systolic BP fluctuations and the subsequent reflex fluctuations in R-R interval of the electrocardiogram. The decrease in BP and risk reduction achieved with CPAP therapy in OSAS patients may be also derived from an improvement in metabolic parameters15 and/or endothelial function.Apart from CPAP, other strategies of treating OSAS have been developed, including oral appliances or surgical procedures (the most popular being uvulopalatoplasty), but their efficacy is questionable and their effects on BP are controversial.An issue of great importance is the choice of the most suitable antihypertensive drug or drugs to be administered to OSAS patients with high BP. Increased sympathetic activity appears to be one of the key mechanisms involved; thus the possible benefit of adrenergic-blocking agents was hypothesized. Although some data are available to support this hypothesis, they do not allow a definite recommendation for this class of drugs in treating OSAS-related hypertension, especially in light of a possible aggravation of metabolic changes frequently present in OSAS patients. Other suggestions focus on use of drugs interfering with the RAAS or long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000119Endocrine HypertensionWilliam F. Young,Jr., in Williams Textbook of Endocrinology (Thirteenth Edition), 2016•There are at least 14 endocrine disorders for which hypertension may be the initial clinical presentation. An accurate diagnosis of endocrine hypertension provides the clinician with a unique treatment opportunity: to render a surgical cure or to achieve a dramatic response with pharmacologic therapy.•Catecholamines affect many cardiovascular and metabolic processes—they increase heart rate, blood pressure, myocardial contractility, and cardiac conduction velocity. The identification of three types of adrenergic receptors (α, β, and dopaminergic receptors) and their subtypes (α1, α2, β1, β2, β3, D1, and D2) has led to understanding of the physiologic responses to endogenous and exogenous administration of catecholamines.•Catecholamine-secreting tumors are rare, with an annual incidence of 2 to 8 cases per 1 million people. Nevertheless, it is important to suspect, confirm, localize, and resect these tumors because (1) the associated hypertension is curable with surgical removal of the tumor, (2) a risk of lethal paroxysm exists, (3) at least 10% of the tumors are malignant, and (4) 40% of these tumors are familial and their detection in the proband may result in early diagnosis in other family members.•Germline mutations are responsible for approximately 40% of all catecholamine-secreting tumors. Mutations contributing to pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma have two general transcription signatures: cluster 1—genes encoding proteins that function in the cellular response to hypoxia, and cluster 2—genes encoding proteins that activate kinase signaling.•Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma must be confirmed biochemically by the presence of increased concentrations of fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines in urine or plasma. Then the tumor should be localized with computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis. Approximately 85% of these tumors are found in the adrenal glands, and 95% are found in the abdomen and pelvis.•Some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms, including those who are asymptomatic and normotensive. Surgical resection of a catecholamine-secreting tumor is a high-risk surgical procedure, and an experienced surgeon-anesthesiologist team is required.•Hypertension, suppressed plasma renin activity, and increased aldosterone excretion characterize the syndrome of primary aldosteronism, which was first described in 1955.•Aldosterone-producing adenoma and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Somatic mutations account for about half of aldosterone-producing adenomas and include mutations in genes encoding components of the potassium channel (KCNJ5); the sodium/potassium and calcium adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) (ATP1A1 and ATP2B3); and a voltage-dependent C-type calcium channel (CACNA1D).•Use of the plasma aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio as a case-detection test, followed by aldosterone suppression for confirmatory testing, has resulted in much higher prevalence estimates for primary aldosteronism—5% to 10% of all patients with hypertension.•The treatment goal in patients with primary aldosteronism is to prevent the morbidity and fatality associated with hypertension, hypokalemia, and cardiovascular damage. Knowing the cause of the primary aldosteronism helps to determine the appropriate treatment. Normalization of blood pressure should not be the only goal—normalization of circulating aldosterone or mineralocorticoid receptor blockade should be part of the management plan for all patients with primary aldosteronism.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323297387000162Secondary HypertensionIn Pathophysiology of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, 2009I INTRODUCTIONAlthough most human hypertension arises from unknown causes and is called essential hypertension or primary hypertension, about 5% to 10% of cases arise from a known cause. These are, as a group, called secondary hypertension (Box 16-1). These cases can be managed more intelligently and sometimes cured if they are identified.It may be helpful to use a mnemonic aid to remember the classical causes of secondary hypertension, such as RECAPS ABCDE (Box 16-2). In this chapter, each type of secondary hypertension will be considered in the sequence dictated by that mnemonic.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416043911500229Systemic HypertensionManish D. Sinha, Christopher J.D. Reid, in Paediatric Cardiology (Third Edition), 2010Miscellaneous Causes of HypertensionDrugsOral contraceptives have already been discussed. Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are potent causes of hypertension, particularly in children with pre-existing renal disease. Sympathomimetic agents can raise the blood pressure even when used as topical preparations363 or in nose drops. Mercury poisoning causing acrodynia, or pink disease, is associated with hypertension. Poisoning with heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead, overdosage of reserpine, methyldopa and phenylcyclidine, and cough syrup containing ephedrine have all caused hypertension.172BurnsSystemic hypertension occurs in one-third of children with severe burns.364 Excessive production of catecholamines, increased renin-angiotensin stimulation, expansion of volume, and hypercalcaemia have been considered in the pathogenesis.172HypercalcaemiaHypercalcaemia is associated with hypertension, probably because of a rise in peripheral vascular resistance.365 The syndrome of infantile hypercalcaemia273 may be associated with renal arterial stenosis and hypertension.Other CausesHypertension occurs in acute intermittent porphyria.366 It can be associated with Turner’s syndrome, even in the absence of aortic coarctation,190,367 and with Marfan syndrome.368 It has been described in pseudoxanthoma elasticum,369 Stevens-Johnson syndrome,370 and acrodermatitis enteropathica.371 It also occurs during sickle cell crisis.372 Ingestion of liquorice, which contains a substance with a mineralocorticoid effect, may cause hypertension that is similar to the hypertension induced by deoxycorticosteroid.373View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978070203064200062XSecondary HypertensionWilliam F. YoungJr., in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Case DetectionSpontaneous hypokalemia is uncommon in patients with uncomplicated hypertension and, when present, strongly suggests associated mineralocorticoid excess. However, several studies have shown that most patients with primary aldosteronism have baseline serum levels of potassium in the normal range.1,2,5,6 Therefore hypokalemia is not and should not be the criterion used for case detection of primary aldosteronism. Patients with hypertension and hypokalemia (regardless of presumed cause), treatment-resistant hypertension (three antihypertensive drugs and BP not at goal), stage 2 hypertension (≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥100 mm Hg diastolic), hypertension and an incidentally discovered adrenal mass, and onset of hypertension at a young age should undergo case detection testing for primary aldosteronism (Fig. 9-1).2,5 In addition, the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism should be considered whenever a secondary hypertension evaluation is performed (e.g., when testing for renovascular disease or pheochromocytoma).In patients with suspected primary aldosteronism, case detection can be accomplished by measuring a morning ambulatory paired random PAC and PRA (preferably between 8 and 10 am) (see Fig. 9-1). This test may be performed while the patient is taking antihypertensive medications (with some exceptions [see later]) and without postural stimulation.2,5 Hypokalemia reduces the secretion of aldosterone, and it is optimal to restore the serum level of potassium to normal before performing diagnostic studies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone and eplerenone) are the only medications that absolutely interfere with interpretation of the ratio and should be discontinued at least 6 weeks before testing. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have the potential to “falsely elevate” PRA. Therefore, in a patient treated with an ACE-I or ARB, the finding of a detectable PRA level, or a low PAC/PRA ratio, does not exclude the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. However, a very useful clinical point is that when a PRA level is undetectably low in a patient taking an ACE-I or ARB, primary aldosteronism is likely. A second important clinical point is that the PRA is suppressed (<1.0 ng/mL per hour) in almost all patients with primary aldosteronism. Treatment with β-adrenergic blockers does decrease measured levels of PRA; however, because PAC is also lowered with these agents, false-positive testing for primary aldosteronism is not an issue.13The PAC/PRA ratio, first proposed as a case-detection test for primary aldosteronism in 1981,14 is based on the concept of paired hormone measurements. For example, in a hypertensive hypokalemic patient: (1) secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g., renovascular disease): should be considered when both PRA and PAC are increased and the PAC/PRA ratio is <10; (2) an alternative source of mineralocorticoid receptor agonism (e.g., hypercortisolism) should be considered when both PRA and PAC are suppressed; and (3) primary aldosteronism should be suspected when PRA is suppressed (<1.0 ng/mL per hour) and PAC is increased. At least 14 prospective studies have been published on the use of the PAC/PRA ratio in detecting primary aldosteronism.15 Although there is some uncertainty about test characteristics and lack of standardization (see later), the PAC/PRA ratio is widely accepted as the case detection test of choice for primary aldosteronism.5 It is important to understand that the lower limit of detection varies among different PRA assays and can have a dramatic effect on the PAC/PRA ratio. For example, if the lower limit of detection for PRA is 0.6 ng/mL per hour and the PAC is 16 ng/dL, then the PAC/PRA ratio would be 27; however, if the lower limit of detection for PRA is 0.1 ng/mL per hour and the PAC is 16 ng/dL, then the PAC/PRA ratio would be 160. Therefore the cutoff for a “high” PAC/PRA ratio is laboratory dependent and, more specifically, PRA assay dependent. In a retrospective study, the combination of a PAC/PRA ratio >30 and PAC >20 ng/dL had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 91% for APA.16 At the Mayo Clinic, a PAC (in ng/dL)/PRA (in ng/mL per hour) ratio of 20 or more and a PAC of at least 15 ng/dL are found in >90% of patients with surgically confirmed APA. In patients without primary aldosteronism, most of the variation occurs within the normal range. A high PAC/PRA ratio is a positive case detection test result and a finding that warrants further testing.2,5It is critical for the clinician to recognize that the PAC/PRA ratio is only a case-detection tool, and most positive results should be followed by a confirmatory aldosterone suppression test to verify autonomous aldosterone production before treatment is initiated.2,5 In a study of 118 subjects with essential hypertension, neither antihypertensive medications nor acute variation of dietary sodium affected the accuracy of the PAC/PRA ratio adversely, with a sensitivity on and off therapy of 73% and 87%, respectively, and a specificity of 74% and 75%, respectively.17 In a study of African American and white subjects with resistant hypertension, the PAC/PRA ratio was elevated (>20) in 45 of 58 subjects with primary aldosteronism and in 35 of 207 patients without primary aldosteronism (sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 83%).18The measurement of PRA is time consuming, shows poor interlaboratory variability, and requires special preanalytical prerequisites. To overcome these disadvantages, a monoclonal antibody against active renin is being used by several reference laboratories to measure plasma renin concentration (PRC) instead of PRA.13,19 Based on several studies, it appears that PRC may be a good alternative to PRA.13,19-21 It is reasonable to consider a positive PAC/PRC test when the PAC is >15 ng/dL and the PRC is below the lower limit of detection for the assay (see Fig. 9-1).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000090Epidemiology and Pathophysiology of Chronic Kidney DiseaseAminu Bello, ... Meguid El Nahas, in Comprehensive Clinical Nephrology (Fourth Edition), 2010HypertensionSystemic hypertension is an important cause, consequence, and presenting feature of CKD. It is one of the leading causes of ESRD worldwide,6 the second leading cause in the United States after diabetes. Some experimental and epidemiologic studies have shown that sustained hypertension is indeed a significant contributor to the progression of CKD. Strong evidence links the progression of CKD to systemic hypertension in diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies (reviewed in reference 1). It is believed that the transmission of systemic hypertension into the glomerular capillary beds and the resulting glomerular hypertension contribute to the progression of glomerulosclerosis (Fig. 75.6).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323058766000757Epigenetics and Arterial HypertensionS. Friso, ... O. Olivieri, in Translating Epigenetics to the Clinic, 2017Arterial Hypertension and EpigeneticsArterial hypertension (AH) is a multifactorial disease, in which a complex pathogenesis involves several mechanisms and endocrine–metabolic systems. Differential etiologies of AH are known to take place in the dynamic interplay among genetic factors and the diverse environmental backgrounds leading to changes in multiple biological pathways that eventually trigger the genesis of this complex disorder that primarily involves the cardiovascular system but can certainly be considered a chronic systemic disease [1–3]. AH is indeed a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease. A large portion of the worldwide population suffers from AH, which gives to this disease the rank of one of the major concerns for public health issues, especially in Western countries [4–9]. To unveil in more depths the pathogenetic routes that stand behind the development of hypertension is, therefore, crucially important to outline efficacious modalities to prevent and treat such a widespread illness [9,10]. Since a positive family history for AH is a well-known major risk factor for the development of the disease, several studies have focused, in the latest years, on examining the genome sequence of people affected by AH to find genetically driven molecular mechanisms that may alter a certain pathway or another by using either a candidate gene or a genome-wide association study approach [1,3,11]. Considering that pathogenetic mechanisms related to kidney function and those related to the function of endocrine systems are the most frequently implied in a number of forms of AH, most studied precisely focused on forms of AH with a genetic background [12–15].Latest genome-wide association studies greatly contributed to the advancement of the comprehension of the part played by the genetic components in hypertensive disease [16–20]. It has become clear, however, that a mere DNA-sequence-based approach may only partially explain the contribution of the genome structure and function in the pathogenesis of hypertension that should instead be considered from a broader point of view which involves epigenetic mechanisms that, despite their heritability, are potentially modifiable by environmental factors [21]. Precisely for their function in gene expression regulation, several phenomena that regulate gene expression through epigenetics are lately emerging as a possible step forward in the understanding of AH development [22] and opened up to novel and more complex role of gene functions that are not merely due to the genome sequence and structure by themselves but to the way by which a specific gene is regulated by heritable mechanisms in disease pathogenesis [21,23]. Epigenetic mechanisms refer precisely to phenomena that are implicated in gene expression regulatory systems that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence or copy number variation but occur over the mere nucleotide sequence of the genome [22].Most of the studies aimed at evaluating the role of epigenetics in AH in humans have focused their interest on DNA methylation, both global [24] and gene-specific, mostly by a gene-target approach [25] while emerging evidence shows a function in AH pathogenesis and progression also for other epigenetic phenomena such as histone modifications and noncoding RNAs [26,27]. This chapter aims at giving an overview of the current knowledge of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in AH by considering the current available observations from cell culture, animal and human studies.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128008027000071The Brain in HypertensionMartin D. Fotherby, ... Thompson G. Robinson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Longitudinal studiesHigh BP in middle age without or with other vascular risk factors has consistently been associated with cognitive decline and dementia of both vascular and Alzheimer type when assessed after follow-up periods of 10 to 25 years.69,72,73 In contrast to studies undertaken in middle-age persons, follow-up of elderly cohorts has shown no consistent association of BP with cognition or dementia. As in younger groups, high BP in the elderly has been related to decline in cognitive performance.71,74 However, in distinction from younger cohorts in the elderly low BP has in some studies been associated with the development of dementia.75,76 Overall, these longitudinal studies strongly suggest an adverse effect of high BP in middle age (and perhaps also older age) on cognitive functioning. There is also an adverse effect of low BP in the elderly for the development of dementia. Follow-up studies examining the effect of BP on brain structural changes provide further evidence for the adverse effect of high BP on cognitive performance.69,77View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500519When Things Go Wrong—Weight, Diabetes and HypertensionPeter C. Hindmarsh, Kathy Geertsma, in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, 2017High blood pressureHigh blood pressure is defined as blood pressure values between 90 and 95 centile. Hypertension is defined as the blood pressure values over the 95th centile. You will see that when blood pressure is recorded, there are two values, a value which is high followed by a value which is lower. These are known as systolic and diastolic blood pressures.They are important because they tell us a lot about how the heart and circulation are responding. You can have high or low blood pressure in either the systolic or diastolic components, but the one that is really important is high systolic blood pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012811483400012XPentraxin-3 and endothelial dysfunctionAlexandru Zlibut, ... Lucia Agoston-Coldea, in Advances in Clinical Chemistry, 20194.1 Arterial hypertensionArterial hypertension is one of the most common risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial alterations are determined by reactive oxygen species resulting from the increased activity of vascular and renal nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate activity and also by complement system activation [41]. Recently, more and more data confirm increased levels of PTX3 in hypertensive subjects and suggest the fact that this molecule can become an independent predictor for arterial hypertension. PTX3 induces biochemical alterations of the vascular layer. Following intricate molecular pathways, PTX3 determines endothelial dysfunction and lowers arterial NO based reactivity by blocking NO signaling. In order to determine the underlying pathogenetic pathways which underpin the link between arterial hypertension and increased plasma levels of PTX3, an important murine study was conducted. Intravenous administration of PTX3 raised the blood pressure and the pathological examination of the vessels identified endothelial dysfunction and morphological alterations. PTX3 was shown to promote vascular changes through P-selectin/MMP-1 pathway and by altering NO signaling [30].In human subjects, clinical studies identified similar results regarding the dynamics of PTX3. Thus, in isolated arterial hypertension without other risk factors, the plasma levels of PTX3 correlated positively and, linearly with both systolic and diastolic values [30,42,43]. However, in a cohort study that evaluated the incidence of subclinical cardiovascular disease, PTX3 levels were correlated only to the systolic blood pressure [44].

MERCIER M.D., ... PETER PETROPOULOS M.D., in Geriatric Clinical Advisor, 2007BASIC INFORMATIONDEFINITIONPulmonary hypertension (PH) is abnormally elevated pressure in the arterial side of the pulmonary circulation, usually defined as mean pulmonary pressure >25 mm Hg at rest or greater than 30 mmHg with exercise. Sustained elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure due to increased pulmonary venous pressure, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, or increased flow is often referred to as secondary pulmonary hypertension.SYNONYMSPrimary pulmonary hypertension (PPH)Secondary pulmonary hypertensionICD-9CM CODES416.0Primary pulmonary hypertension416.8Secondary pulmonary hypertensionEPIDEMIOLOGY & DEMOGRAPHICS•Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is rare, occurring in 2 cases per 1 million people per year, with an overall prevalence estimated at 1,300 per million.•PPH is more common in women than men (1.7:1).•Secondary pulmonary hypertension is more common than PPH.•Secondary pulmonary hypertension is the common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to cor pulmonale in patients with underlying pulmonary disease (e.g., COPD, pulmonary embolism).PHYSICAL FINDINGS & CLINICAL PRESENTATIONPrimary pulmonary hypertension:•PPH is insidious and may go undetected for years.•Exertional dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom (60%).•Fatigue and weakness.•Syncope.•Chest pain.•Loud P2 component of the second heart sound.•Right-sided S4.•Jugular venous distention.•Abdominal distention/ascites.•Prominent parasternal (RV) impulse.•Holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation murmur heard best along the left fourth parasternal line that increases in intensity with inspiration.•Peripheral edema.Secondary pulmonary hypertension:•Similar to PPH but depends on the underlying cause (e.g., left-sided CHF, mitral stenosis, COPD).ETIOLOGY•The etiology of PPH is unknown. Most cases are sporadic, but there is a 6% to 12% familial incidence.•PPH is associated with several known risk factors: portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis, appetite-suppressant drugs (fenfluramine), and HIV disease.•Several genetic abnormalities have been associated with the familial form of PPH, many of which are mutations in the genes that code for members of the TGF-_ family of receptors (BMPR-II, ALK-1) on chromosome 2q33.•Familial PPH is an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, affecting only about 10% to 20% of carriers.•Several factors have been identified that play a role in the pathogenesis of PPH, including a genetic predisposition, endothelial cell dysfunction, abnormalities in vasomotor control, thrombotic obliteration of the vascular lumen, and vascular remodeling through cell proliferation and matrix production. An emerging theory involves abnormal membrane potassium channels modulating calcium kinetics.•Secondary pulmonary hypertension is primarily caused by underlying pulmonary and cardiac conditions including:1.Pulmonary thromboembolic disease2.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)3.Interstitial lung disease4.Obstructive sleep disorder5.Neuromuscular diseases causing hypoventilation (e.g., ALS)6.Collagen-vascular disease (e.g., SLE, CREST, systemic sclerosis)7.Pulmonary venous disease8.Left ventricular failure resulting from hypertension, CAD, aortic stenosis, and cardiomyopathy9.Valvular heart disease (e.g., mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation)10.Congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunting (e.g., ASD)View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032304195950016XPulmonary HypertensionPeter Abel, in xPharm: The Comprehensive Pharmacology Reference, 2007EpidemiologyThe global incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension is approximately 2 per million. However, in certain high risk populations, the incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension is significantly higher. Primary pulmonary hypertension develops more often in females than males, with younger females being most likely to develop this condition. The overall survival rate is approximately 30–40% three years after diagnosis of the condition.Secondary pulmonary hypertension is usually found as a complication of pulmonary or cardiac disorders. Thus, although its incidence is unknown, it is directly related to the incidence of the conditions that lead to this disorder. Secondary pulmonary hypertension is more common than primary pulmonary hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080552323600601Mitral RegurgitationKari Bevevino, Cristobal Navas de Solis, in Comparative Veterinary Anatomy, 2022DiagnosisHeart failure caused by severe mitral valve disease and a ruptured chorda tendinea, together with tricuspid valvular disease and pulmonary hypertension Tricuspid valve disease in combination with pulmonary hypertension was causing signs of right-sided heart failure in this horse. Pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral edema, jugular distention, atrial fibrillation, and jugular pulses are all consequences of biventricular heart failure. Thickening of the atrioventricular valves suggested that valvulitis could have been the underlying cause of the cardiac disease and progressed slowly over time. Atrial fibrillation and/or rupture of the chorda tendinea may have caused the recent acute decompensation of cardiac disease in this case.Mitral Valve InsufficiencyThe lesions that lead to mitral valve insufficiency can be degenerative, inflammatory, congenital, infectious, or idiopathic. Echocardiography can be used to evaluate the degree of regurgitation as well as—sometimes—the specific valvular lesion. In many cases, the cause of the mitral valve disease can only be surmised. As with this case, pre- and—more specifically—postmortem findings supported an inflammatory condition (valvulitis). In early stages of mild mitral regurgitation, cardiac output can be maintained and no apparent clinical signs are recognized. However, as mitral regurgitation progresses, cardiac output becomes compromised and clinical signs—such as exercise intolerance, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased respiratory effort, and/or lethargy—may become apparent. An increasing volume of regurgitated blood at the mitral valve leads to volume overload of the left atrium and eventually atrial dilatation and an increase in left atrial pressures. This can progress to cause pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323910156001515The Lung in Autoimmune DiseasesAlbert Selva-O'Callaghan, Ernesto Trallero-Araguás, in Handbook of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, 2022Pulmonary hypertensionPH, defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥20 mmHg at rest as assessed by right heart catheterization, is not a rare complication of ASS [6]. In a retrospective study, Hervier et al. reported a catheterization-confirmed 7.9% prevalence of PH [6]. This value is similar to data reported in patients with other CTDs such as systemic lupus erythematosus [169], but it is slightly lower than that described in SSc [170]. PH can be caused by various pathophysiological mechanisms, which should differentiate to provide appropriate treatment according to each underlying condition. In contrast to other CTDs, PH in ASS seems to be mainly secondary to ILD (Group 3 of the clinical classification of PH), whereas primary vasculopathy of the small pulmonary arteries (Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension, defined as PH in the absence of other causes of precapillary PH such as ILD or chronic thromboembolic PH, among others) is, for instance, the most frequent PH form in SSc. However, indirect evidence suggests probable primary pulmonary vascular involvement in the development of PH in ASS patients. Most patients with PH and ILD have severe PH that is considered disproportionate to the degree of interstitial involvement. In addition, a high percentage of these patients have an FVC/DLCO ratio >1.8, a parameter proposed as a marker of pulmonary vascular disease in SSc [6].PH has been associated with a poorer prognosis and lower survival rates in ASS patients. Therefore, PH screening could be considered a recommended practice in these patients. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most used screening test for PH. It could be performed at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially in patients with severe dyspnea with no compatible HRCT findings or with a DLCO drop out of proportion to the FVC drop. When elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is estimated on echocardiography, right heart catheterization is needed to confirm the PH diagnosis.Treatment of PH in ASS patients follows the general principles of PH management. Immunosuppressive treatment of ILD is indicated to stop progression of the underlying condition. Supplementary oxygen and diuretic therapy are mainstays of PH-ILD treatment in patients with hypoxemia (at rest, or during exercise or sleep) and fluid retention from PH-related right ventricular failure. The potential benefit of drugs specifically directed to reduce pulmonary arterial hypertension, such as prostacyclin pathway agonists, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or nitric oxide-cGMP enhancers, is controversial and usually limited to patients in WHO functional class III or IV. However, considering that PH in some ASS patients can be ocassionally unrelated to their lung disease, these treatments could be used in selected cases in the setting of center with expertise in PH management.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323910835000050Evaluation of Pulmonary SarcoidosisDominique Valeyre MD, ... Jean-François Bernaudin MD, PhD, in Sarcoidosis, 2019Pulmonary HypertensionPrecapillary PH is rarely observed at diagnosis workup. It often occurs lately, 59–313 months after sarcoidosis diagnosis in the context of stage 4 for 72% of patients. PH must be sought in patients with persistent dyspnea, as 83% of them have NYHA functional class III or IV dyspnea, FVC% of predicted value to DLCO% of predicted value over 1.4–1.5, a pulmonary artery/aorta diameter ratio > 1 at CT, abnormal 6MWT distance, or PH suspicion at echocardiography. Only right catheterization can confirm PH diagnosis and eliminate postcapillary PH. PH follow-up is specifically discussed in Nunes’ chapter.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032354429000015XPulmonary Hypertension and CancerD. Geft, A. Hage, in Cardio-Oncology, 2017Definition of PHPH is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥25 mmHg at rest as assessed by right heart catheterization (RHC) [5]. PAH refers to a group of PH patients characterized hemodynamically by the presence of precapillary PH, defined by a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤15 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 3 Wood units (WU) in the absence of other causes of precapillary PH, such as PH due to lung diseases, chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH) or other rare diseases [6]. A PAWP > 15 implies at least some component of PH related to post capillary processes, most commonly left heart disease. One of the most common problems in the diagnostic workup of patients with PH is the distinction between PAH and PH due to left heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). A normal PAWP at rest does not rule out the presence of HFpEF, a common confounding etiology of PH. Volume or exercise challenge during right heart catheterization may be useful to unmask the presence of left heart disease [5]. While the normal mPAP at rest is 14 ± 3 mmHg with an upper limit of normal of approximately 20 mmHg [7], the clinical significance of a mPAP between 21 and 24 mmHg is unclear.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128035474000185VASCULAR DISEASEI. Adatia, in Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine, 2006PAH Associated with Liver DiseasePortopulmonary HypertensionPulmonary hypertension complicating liver disease is recognized increasingly, although the reported incidence varies from 0.7% of autopsies undertaken in patients with liver disease to 10% of a general population of patients. However, in patients referred for liver transplant the incidence is as high as 16%.PathogenesisThe mechanism of porto-PAH is unclear. There is no relationship between the development of pulmonary hypertension and severity of the liver disease or synthetic function. Pulmonary hypertension seems to be more closely related to the degree of portal hypertension as discussed in the section on hepatopulmonary syndrome. Patients with liver disease have increased cardiac output and the increased shear stress may lead to endothelial damage and subsequent vasoconstriction. The pulmonary vascular disease may progress with clinical radiographic and histological features indistinguishable from familial or idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.The presence of severe pulmonary hypertension has a marked impact on survival, with a median survival of 6 months. Five-year actuarial survival is reported between 10% and 50%.Treatment of the pulmonary hypertension follows the same algorithm as for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension with the exception of liver transplantation. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension due to an elevated cardiac output is reversible following liver transplantation, without significantly higher mortality. Patients with severe pulmonary hypertension have a high mortality both from complications of pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction and from the deleterious effect that elevated hepatic venous pressure has on the new graft.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0123708796004208Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With SarcoidosisHilario Nunes MD, PhD, ... Dominique Valeyre MD, in Sarcoidosis, 2019AbstractPulmonary hypertension (PH) affects 6% of unselected sarcoidosis patients, but its prevalence is much higher in advanced pulmonary disease. Although capillary bed destruction and resultant hypoxemia are central, the mechanisms of sarcoidosis PH are multifactorial, including left heart dysfunction, specific pulmonary vasculopathy, extrinsic vascular compression by enlarged lymph nodes or fibrosing mediastinitis, and portal hypertension. There is no validated screening algorithm for the detection of sarcoidosis PH, but right heart catheterization may be important to exclude postcapillary PH, which is frequently underestimated by echocardiography. PH portends a poor prognosis in sarcoidosis. The cornerstone of management is supportive therapy (supplemental oxygen and diuretics) and lung transplantation if appropriate. Patients with sarcoidosis PH may occasionally respond to immunosuppressive therapy according to the underlying mechanisms. Fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography is helpful to identify these patients with persistent granulomatous process. Pulmonary arterial hypertension agents may be offered in severe sarcoidosis PH cases, with a potential hemodynamic benefits but inconsistent effect on exercise capacity and quality of life.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323544290000240Role of Cytokines and Inflammation in HypertensionMichael J. Ryan, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Pulmonary hypertensionPulmonary hypertension results from altered vascular function (constriction and thickening) that leads to increased pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs. Inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in vascular dysfunction that is prevalent during pulmonary hypertension. Serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 are reportedly increased,27 and lung biopsies from individuals with primary pulmonary hypertension showed increased expression of RANTES.92 RANTES attracts T lymphocytes and monocytes, which are the most abundant infiltrates in pulmonary hypertension. Like other cytokines, RANTES activates ET-1,93 which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.94A role for cytokines has also been demonstrated in experimental models of pulmonary hypertension. For example, transgenic mice overexpressing TNF-α develop pulmonary hypertension,95 while TNF-α receptor knockout mice do not develop pulmonary hypertension in response to bleomycin, an anticancer therapy that induces pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension in rodents.96 Bleomycin-induced pulmonary hypertension in mice is mediated by TNF-α and downstream mediators NFκB and AP1.96 IL-6 infusion has been shown to cause pulmonary hypertension in rats that is preventable by neutralizing IL-6 antibodies.97 ET-1 may also play an important role in IL-6–mediated pulmonary hypertension based on data from cell culture studies showing that pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells have an augmented production of pre-proendothelin and ET-1 in response to TNF-α or IFN-γ.98 These data are consistent with a role for the endothelin system in cytokine-mediated hypertension, and is similar to what has been reported in preeclampsia.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500258Pulmonary Hypertension☆P.W. Abel, C.M. Kieffer, in Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences, 2014ClassificationAlthough pulmonary hypertension may be classified in a number of different ways, the most widely accepted classification scheme is the Pulmonary Hypertension World Health Organization (WHO) clinical classification system (Dana Point 2008) Simonneau et al (2009), Fishman (2001). This classification divides this condition into five general groups with subgroups, based on pathologic and clinical characteristics. The general groups are, Group (1) Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Group (2) Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease; Group (3) Pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia; Group (4) Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; Group (5) Pulmonary hypertension with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms. There is also a WHO functional classification of pulmonary hypertension based on patient activity levels Rich (1998). These classes are, Class (I) Patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitations of physical activity; Class (II) Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in slight limitation of physical activity; Class (III) Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity; Class (IV) Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without symptoms. Primary pulmonary hypertension, disease with no known cause, is listed by the International Classification of Diseases, Revision 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system under the heading of ‘Diseases of pulmonary circulation’. Primary pulmonary hypertension is assigned the ICD-9-CM number 416.0.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383052557Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of Veterinary CardiologyJournalThe Veterinary JournalJournalVeterinary ParasitologyJournalCell ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

It is frequently associated with functional and/or structural changes in the target organ (heart, brain, kidneys, and blood vessels) and metabolic changes, with a consequent increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events [20].The prevalence of SAH in cancer patients before the introduction of angiogenesis inhibitors was similar to that of the adult population in general, between 32% and 48%. However, with the increased survival of cancer patients, and with the increased use of CT drugs related to SAH, the latter has been a more frequent diagnosis in these patients. The chemotherapeutics most related to SAH are angiogenesis inhibitors because they act on neurohormonal factors, such as renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines, inhibiting the growth receptor tyrosine kinase activity vascular endothelium, responsible for increased capillary permeability, nitric oxide production, migration, and proliferation of endothelial cells, resulting in vasoconstriction and sodium retention.7.1 Clinical manifestations/diagnosisSAH, in most cases, does not result in symptoms. It is an asymptomatic disease; however, when clinical manifestations occur, it causes complications, increasing morbidity and mortality, and worsening quality of life. It is manifested by hypertensive encephalopathy, stroke, acute pulmonary edema, ACS, malignant hypertension, and renal failure. The level of BP considered adequate in cancer patients is similar to that used in the adult population.The prevention of SAH begins before the beginning of antineoplastic therapy, identifying the cardiovascular profile of the patient so that later it is decided on the therapeutic approach (hygienic dietary changes, selection of drugs, dose administered during each session, cumulative dose, route of administration, drugs, and drug sequence).7.2 TreatmentAccording to risk stratification considerations, goals should always be pursued, as the control of SAH should allow patients to tolerate the maximum effective dose of treatment with CT and benefit from the control of tumor growth for a long period, improving quality and the duration of life. Hygienic dietary changes should always be encouraged, emphasizing the recommendation of a low-sodium diet and regular physical activity. However, nonpharmacological strategies are not always sufficient and adequate, due to the compromised performance status of many patients with advanced neoplasia. Thus, in this group, early pharmacological intervention should be considered. Every patient with stage 1 SAH (≥   140/90 mmHg) or an increase in diastolic BP by 20 mmHg or more should start antihypertensive therapy.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323904612000146Endothelium and Arterial HypertensionFernanda Marciano Consolim-Colombo, Luiz Aparecido Bortolotto, in Endothelium and Cardiovascular Diseases, 2018AbstractSystemic arterial hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and vascular wall alterations including the endothelium; the latter contributes key mechanisms for hypertensive disease and its complications. Endothelial dysfunction is observed in hypertension animal models as well as in hypertensive humans since early stages of disease. Recent investigations regarding pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction indicate the oxidative stress, increased inflammatory activity, immunological modifications contribute to hypertension development as well as for maintenance of functional and structural vascular alterations characteristic of hypertension. A major alteration occurs in large vessels, which show increased rigidity, and has been identified as an important risk marker in different populations, especially among hypertensives. Several classes of anti-hypertensive drugs are efficacious in reducing cardiovascular risks and hypertension complications, both by reducing blood pressure and by improving vascular function through endothelial protection. Hence, understanding functional endothelial alterations in hypertension, and the influence of anti-hypertensive treatment of hypertensive disease, may allow better blood pressure control and a reduction in associated cardiovascular diseases.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128123485000283Medical RetinaSanjay Sharma, Gary C.

In fact, it is the most common, most easily diagnosed, and one of the most reversible risk factors (Blacher et al., 2016). Acute hypertension is associated with hypertensive encephalopathy and eclampsia. Chronic hypertension is associated with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, atherosclerosis, periventricular white matter disease, and dementia. High blood pressure is the greatest single contributor to the global burden of disease, accounting for two-thirds of all strokes and half of all ischemic heart disease worldwide (Dahlof, 2007; Lim et al., 2012). Hypertension remains the leading risk factor for death globally. Importantly, antihypertensive treatment can substantially reduce the prevalence and severity of these neurologic diseases.Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures are clinically relevant. In the general population, both roughly follow a normal distribution. In the majority of the world and up until 2017 in the United States, hypertension was defined as a SBP of 140 mmHg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or greater. By this definition, over 1 billion people worldwide are afflicted. With the rising prevalence of obesity and advanced age, by the year 2025, 1.5 billion people are projected to have hypertension (Poulter et al., 2015). In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (AHA) released a new set of hypertension guidelines lowering the threshold between prehypertension and hypertension to 130 mmHg systolic and 80 mmHg diastolic blood pressure (Whelton et al., 2018). The change means 46% of US adults are identified as having high blood pressure, compared with 32% under the previous definition.The effect of hypertension on organ dysfunction is well documented. Uniquely, blood flow to the brain is highly regulated to maintain a consistent level of flow for stable brain function. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is termed autoregulation. In autoregulation, the physiologic response to acute elevation in blood pressure is constriction of small arteries in the brain to counteract the increase in flow that would take place as a result of the higher aortic and extracranial arterial blood pressure and thereby protect the more distal, thin-walled vessels from pressure loads they would otherwise be unable to handle. Acute severe hypertension above a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of approximately 150 mmHg exceeds the autoregulatory capacity and results in increased cerebral blood flow. When thin-walled vessels like capillaries are exposed to the increased pressure and flow, endothelial injury may occur resulting in breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (Johansson, 1999). Chronic hypertension leads to remodeling of the cerebral vasculature with medial hypertrophy and luminal narrowing. This results in a brain-protective shift of the autoregulation curve to allow for constancy of flow at a higher window of blood pressures (Heistad and Baumbach, 1992). However, the deleterious consequences of this vascular remodeling are endothelial dysfunction, impaired arterial relaxation, and decreased ability to augment cerebral blood flow at lower blood pressures. Chronic hypertension also predisposes to atherosclerosis, which can affect the entire arterial path from aorta to intracerebral small vessels.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128198148000184Retinal Artery ObstructionsPurnima S.

You-Tang Shen, in Animal Models for the Study of Human Disease, 2013Pulmonary HypertensionLike systemic arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension is also divided into primary and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. In contrast with systemic arterial hypertension, secondary pulmonary hypertension is much more common than primary pulmonary hypertension. The causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension include blood clots, artery constriction, and heart and lung dysfunction. Several animal models have been studied. The most commonly used models in small animal species are the hypoxia- and chemical-induced pulmonary hypertension models.32 More recently, genetically manipulated mouse models have been generated, which provide insight into the role of specific cellular targets in the pulmonary hypertensive process.32 We adapted both hypoxia- and thromboxane-induced pulmonary hypertension from our previous studies in larger animal species, using pig models.33 Briefly, hypoxia is induced under anesthesia with ventilation, by changes in the fraction of inspired O2 to a level of about 0.1, via introduction of N2 into the inspiratory limb of the ventilator. The mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated by 5–10 mmHg from baseline levels in the pig model. Chronic thromboxane-induced pulmonary hypertension results in a greater increase in pulmonary artery pressure than in hypoxia-induced hypertension. The major limitation of these models is that the mechanism of hypertension is very different from human pulmonary hypertension.It is known that acute pulmonary embolism is also a major cause of pulmonary hypertension, which can be mimicked by administration of air, blood clots, or synthetic microspheres in animal models.34 We have modified the microsphere injection method and made it possible for direct and repeated administration of microspheres, directly into the pulmonary circulation, in a chronically instrumented conscious pig model. Under continuously monitored cardiac output, pulmonary pressure, systemic arterial pressure, and right and left atrial pressure along with SPO2, glass microspheres can be infused multiple times, several hours to days apart. The increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance can be doubled, but it returns towards the baseline level within 24 hours. Repeated injections (five to six times within a 2-week period) result in chronic elevation of mean pulmonary artery pressure by approximately 10–15 mmHg. By using a chronically implanted catheter technique, this model can be studied in the fully conscious state. An example of a recording from a conscious pig before and after microsphere injection is shown in Fig. 8.14. Microsphere injection into the pulmonary circulation does not produce any significant changes in left ventricular pressure, arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, and cardiac output, but increases pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial pressure.FIGURE 8.14. Phasic waveforms of left ventricular (LV) pressure, rate of change of LV pressure (dP/dt), aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, and right atrial (RA) pressure in a conscious pig subjected to microsphere injection.Note that microsphere injection into the pulmonary artery induced a significant increase in pulmonary artery pressure and right atrial pressure, but did not change any other measurements.Source: Authors’ unpublished data.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158948000087Nonadrenal Endocrine HypertensionJ. Enrique Silva, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007HYPERTENSION IN PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISMNumerous studies show that systemic arterial hypertension is more frequent in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) than in the appropriately matched general population.43–46 A number of vascular abnormalities have been reported in patients with PHP, some of which may play a pathogenic role while others may be consequence of vascular stress. PHP patients have endothelial dysfunction as revealed by impaired flow-mediated dilation of medium-size arteries,47 which is reversible after successful parathyroidectomy.48 However, the mechanical properties of the arteries such as isobaric distensibility, pulse wave velocity, and intima media thickness, were not altered by recent-onset PHP, nor were they modified by parathyroidectomy in patients with PHP without hypertension or kidney involvement or any other known vascular risk factor such as diabetes or hypercholesterolemia.49More recently, a study showed increased arterial stiffness in mild PHP.50 The authors used the augmentation index (AI) as a measure of stiffness. The AI basically represents the increase in systolic pressure due to the reflection of the initial pressure wave caused by the ventricular ejection, the timing and magnitude of which are functions of artery compliance. When corrected by all confounding variables, PHP was a stronger predictor of elevated AI than age, gender, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes, and AI correlated significantly with the levels of PTH and inversely with radius mineral density, used in the study as a cumulative effect of PTH.50 The discrepancy between these two reports49,50 is probably explained by age and length of the disease, as in the latter50 patients were significantly older and had been hyperparathyroid for longer time periods than in the aforementioned study.49 Altogether, these results suggest that PHP is associated with functional abnormalities of blood vessels that lead to hypertension, but vascular remodeling takes time and probably requires the contribution of other factors. Compensatory mechanisms may be one such factor and a source of variability in the timing and magnitude of the elevation of blood pressure in PHP. For example, patients with PHP have higher levels of adrenomedullin, a vasodilator, and while mean levels are higher among those that are hypertensive, not all hypertensive patients with PHP have high adrenomedullin.51The mechanisms leading to vascular changes and hypertension in PHP have been only partially identified and are not yet well characterized. Acute injections of parathyroid hormone (PTH) itself cause hypotension in a dose-dependent manner in several species, but most prominently in dogs.52 PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), acting on the same receptors, also has a clear vasodilating effect.53 Furthermore, these hormones cause substantial reduction of intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle,54,55 although in some instances a transient increase has been reported.56 PTH receptors have been identified in endothelial cells.57,58 Another potential mechanism mediating an acute vasodilating response is a reduction of endothelin-1, because this is sensitive to inhibition by PTHrP acting presumably via the PTH receptor.59How then to explain the higher frequency of hypertension in patients with PHP? As mentioned above, in spite of the acute vasodilating effects of PTH, there is an impaired dilation response to increase flow that is reversible with parathyroidectomy.47,48 There are several possible mechanisms to explain the hypertension and impaired dilation responses. One is obviously hypercalcemia, whether general or limited to a vascular territory (i.e., forearm), has been associated with impaired endothelial vasodilatory function, and when systemic, with a significant increase in blood pressure.60 It has been found that intracellular calcium is increased in platelets of patients with PHP, in proportion to the increase in serum Ca and PTH. Interestingly, platelet Ca is increased and more than in PHP in patients with essential hypertension, which lends support to the use of platelets as surrogates for vascular smooth muscle. In PHP, platelet Ca normalized promptly following parathyroidectomy.61 Another interesting factor is that hypercalcemic states, PHP included, are associated with increased levels of norepinephrine and, most importantly, increased pressor response to exogenous norepinephrine.62In addition to the effects of PTH on blood vessels, several lines of evidence point to effects on myocardial contractility. One study showed no effect of acutely injected PTH on myocardial contractility, but in patients with PHP there were changes suggesting increased heart sympathetic activity such as shortening of the relaxation and loss of circadian variation of heart rate.63 Two other studies showed increased ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac output in patients with PHP that were at least partially reversible with parathyroidectomy.64,65 Finally, other investigations have shown left ventricular hypertrophy, above and beyond the expected from the hypertension.66,67 Thus, it appears that increased cardiac output, which is, at least in part, adrenergically mediated, could contribute to the hypertension seen in patients with PHP.Finally, parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) is also a contributing factor. PHF was discovered in the circulation of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Injected into normotensive rats, PHF causes a delayed (60 to 90 min) increase in arterial BP (see Pang et al.68 for a review). Subsequent studies in animals and then in isolated parathyroid cells or tissues showed that the source of this factor was the parathyroid glands.69,70 The chemical structure has not yet been completely defined, but is believed to be a peptide linked to a phospholipid.69,71,72 About 30% to 40% of patients with hypertension have elevated PHF, most notably those exhibiting a low-renin, salt-sensitive form of hypertension, in whom PHF correlates well with BP.73 The PHF mechanism of action was shown to rely mainly on the opening of L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells with an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and possibly sensitization to norepinephrine and perhaps other hypertensive factors.74 It is possible that PHF is responsible for the hypertension in a substantial portion of patients with PHP. In 9 of 10 of these patients with hypertension, PHF was elevated and its elevation predicted a BP reduction following parathyroidectomy.75It is also very interesting that circulating Ca2+ regulates PHF, and its secretion can be reduced by substances acting on the parathyroid calcium sensor receptor,76 whereas 1,25-di-OH vitamin D3 stimulates its secretion, and more in SHR than in their normotensive cognates.77 These are interesting observations that have the potential to explain clinical observations such as the beneficial effect of calcium supplementation in the management of hypertension.78 Elevation of PTH in hyperparathyroidism might contribute to hypertension via increasing the synthesis of 1,25-di-OH vitamin D3 by the kidney, which will in turn increase the secretion of PHF.Although several studies have reported BP normalization in significant fractions of the PHP cohorts studied,44–46 others have failed to document a significant reduction in BP following successful surgical treatment of the PHP.79–81 It is likely that discrepancies derive from differences in the populations studied and in the endpoints of the studies. In two of these studies, the hypertensive patients had more severe disease with greater kidney damage80,81 than the normotensive patients, suggesting that they had moved into a phase of irreversibility due to end-organ damage. The third study compared blood pressure longtime after the surgery (15 years) with that existing prior to parathyroidectomy in a cohort with a mean age of 58, and during this period many patients became hypertensive, regardless of treatment and calcium status.79 In general, these three studies79–81 aimed at assessing the long-term cardiovascular risk of not surgically treating the primary hyperparathyroidism. However, in another large cohort study in Denmark that compared patients surgically treated with those kept under observation, the authors observed no difference in the prevalence of hypertension, but mortality during the follow-up occurred in 31% of surgically treated patients compared to 37% of conservatively treated patients (Figure 73-2).82 There are limits to this study. First, the overall frequency of hypertension in both groups was very low, 4% to 5%, but more important was the bias that patients undergoing surgery are generally those with more severe hyperparathyroidism and more end-organ damage.From a practical viewpoint, it is reasonable to accept the potential of PHP to cause hypertension or enhance essential or secondary pre-existing hypertension. If PHP is not prolonged, and there is no evidence of arterial and kidney damage, parathyroidectomy is likely to result in reduction of BP or in making pre-existing hypertension more manageable.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500763Postoperative Management Beyond the Intensive Care UnitRichard Ruiz, ... Göran B.G. Klintmalm, in Transplantation of the Liver (Third Edition), 2015HypertensionBoth cyclosporine and tacrolimus induce systemic arterial hypertension as a side effect, although hypertension is more common with cyclosporine. Liver transplant recipients may also experience hypertension from the mineralocorticoid effect of steroids, as well as from genetic predisposition and as a result of obesity. As the prevalence of obesity in liver transplant recipients increases, the side effects associated with this comorbidity, including hypertension, diabetes, and renal insufficiency, are becoming more common.Strategies for treating posttransplant hypertension vary.18,19 We treat all patients in an aggressive fashion if their blood pressure exceeds 160/100 mm Hg. However, in patients requiring long-term therapy, we aim to keep blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg. The first line of therapy is to ensure the appropriateness of the patient's tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose by means of sampled trough blood levels. Systolic or diastolic hypertension in the absence of toxic immunosuppressant levels warrants pharmacological therapy. Our preference is for an agent that does not interfere with cyclosporine or tacrolimus metabolism and the cytochrome P-450 pathway. When a second agent is required, we generally use a selective β-receptor antagonist such as atenolol.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455702688000713Postoperative Management Beyond the Intensive Care Unit: AdultsEDMUND Q. SANCHEZ, GORAN B. KLINTMALM, in Transplantation of the Liver (Second Edition), 2005HypertensionBoth cyclosporine and tacrolimus induce systemic arterial hypertension as a side effect (Table 58-2).38 Whereas the mechanism of cyclosporine-induced hypertension may well be linked to higher sympathetic tone or acquired renal insufficiency, that of tacrolimus remains obscure.39 Because both drugs increase calcineurin intracellular activity to a similar extent (although through two very different drug receptors), their toxicity profiles may be linked. Indeed, clinical experience reveals the remarkably similar toxic side effects of these agents.36Liver transplant recipients, of course, may also experience hypertension from the mineralocorticoid effect of their steroid immunosuppressants, from genetic predisposition, or as a result of obesity. Their medication-induced risk only adds to that found in the general population.Strategies for treating posttransplant hypertension vary. We treat all patients in an aggressive fashion if their blood pressure exceeds 160/100 mm Hg. However, in patients who require chronic therapy, we aim to keep their blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg. The first line of therapy is to ensure the appropriateness of a patient's tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose by means of sampled trough blood levels.38 Systolic or diastolic hypertension in the absence of toxic immunosuppressant levels warrants pharmacological therapy. Our preference is for agents that do not interfere with cyclosporine or tacrolimus metabolism and the cytochrome P450 pathway. One drug that interferes with this pathway is diltiazem. It inhibits CYP3A, P-glycoprotein, and tacrolimus metabolism in a predictable fashion.40 Patients who respond to sublingual nifedipine (Procardia) are good candidates for the sustained-release Procardia XL, which is administered only once or twice a day. When a second agent is required, we generally add a selective β-receptor antagonist such as atenolol. More recently, we have also begun using transdermal preparations of the α-receptor agonist clonidine (Catapres-TTS), which are dose metered and quite convenient from a patient compliance standpoint. Amlodipine besylate (Norvasc) is another commonly used medication that is quite effective; however, its use must be adjusted according to liver function.Control of hypertension is of utmost importance in liver transplant recipients, especially long-term control. In a study of 181 liver transplant recipients,41 a significant increase in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke) was found when compared with the general population. Hypertension was seen in 77% of these patients, and the risk for coronary heart disease was calculated to be 11.5% 1 year after transplantation versus 7% in the general population. By minimizing the contributory risk factors for cardiovascular disease, long-term patient survival can be optimized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978072160118250063XSYSTEMIC HYPERTENSION: WHAT TO LOOK FORGerald de Lacey MA, MB, B Chir, FRCR, ... Laurence Berman MB, BS, FRCP, FRCR, in The Chest X-Ray: A Survival Guide, 2008COARCTATION OF THE AORTAThis is the one cause of systemic arterial hypertension in which evaluation of the CXR must include more than an assessment of cardiac complications. There are two circumstances:▪In a particular patient the physician may, on clinical examination, consider that coarctation is possible.▪The diagnosis may be completely unsuspected. The CXR findings may be the first intimation of coarctation. Most of the coarctations that present after the first year of life are usually post-ductal and these patients are often symptom free. Frequently aortic coarctation is discovered incidentally, not simply because of hypertension or a murmur but serendipitously because of an abnormal CXR.EVALUATING THE CXR3–5The narrowing of the aorta is shown in Fig. 31.1.Look for—rib notching3,5▪Resulting from the development of a collateral circulation involving the posterior intercostal arteries. The dilated arteries cause pressure erosion of the posterior and inferior aspects of the ribs. Only ribs 3–9 are affected.▪Usually bilateral; occasionally unilateral. The notching is often asymmetrical (Fig. 31.2). Notching is rarely evident below the age of five years.▪The roof of each notch shows some reactive sclerosis5 (i.e. density), because the dilated posterior intercostal arteries exert a longstanding pressure effect on the ribs.Look for—an abnormal mediastinal shadow3An abnormal aortic knuckle is usual in adults. It is often evident even in young children. There are a variety of configurations (Figs 31.3–31.6)3.1.Double knuckle:The “figure 3” configuration. The superior bulge is caused by an enlarged left subclavian artery and/or the aortic arch. The inferior bulge is due to post-stenotic dilatation of the aorta (Fig. 31.3).2.High knuckle:Caused by an enlarged left subclavian artery and/or aortic arch…but there is no appreciable post-stenotic dilatation (Fig. 31.4).3.Low knuckle:The post-stenotic dilatation is the dominant shadow (Fig. 31.5).4.Flat knuckle:Due to an inconspicuous left subclavian artery, a small aortic arch, and no post-stenotic dilatation (Fig. 31.6).Look for—cardiac enlargementIn children with coarctation an enlarged heart is common and is due to left ventricular hypertrophy3. Adults with coarctation usually have a normal cardio-thoracic ratio unless there is accompanying aortic valve disease or heart failure.Figure 31.7. Adult. Coarctation. The main finding is the posterior and inferior rib notching. The mediastinum demonstrates a (somewhat) high knuckle appearance.AN INTERESTING CONDITION—PSEUDOCOARCTATION (AKA KINKED AORTA)6–8Aetiology/pathologyClosely related to coarctation but there is no pressure gradient across nor obstruction to the aortic lumen. An elongated and high aorta is kinked at the isthmus. There is no collateral circulation and so there is no rib notching.Clinical featuresNo abnormal findings attributable to the kink. Often detected solely as an incidental left sided “mediastinal mass” on a CXR.The CXRA left-sided “mass” is projected above the aortic arch. A lateral CXR is very useful and will usually suggest that the mass is simply due to the high aortic arch. A CT examination with sagittal reconstruction will exclude a mass lesion or an aortic aneurysm and will confirm the diagnosis of pseudocoarctation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702030468500363Recommended publicationsInfo iconInternational Journal of CardiologyJournalThe American Journal of CardiologyJournalJournal of the American Society of EchocardiographyJournalJournal of the American College of CardiologyJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

      "ScienceDirectJournals & BooksSearchRegisterSign inPortal HypertensionPortal hypertension is defined as a portal pressure of greater than 12mm Hg or a hepatic venous wedge pressure that exceeds the pressure of the inferior vena cava by >5mm Hg. The portal hypertension of cirrhosis is caused by the disruption of hepatic sinusoids, leading to increased resistance in the portal venous system.From: Critical Care Secrets (Fifth Edition), 2013Related terms:AscitesHepatic Portal VeinVaricesTherapeutic ProcedurePatientInpatientLiver DiseaseLiver CirrhosisView all TopicsAdd to MendeleySet alertAbout this pagePortal HypertensionRiccardo Superina, in Pediatric Surgery (Seventh Edition), 2012DefinitionPortal hypertension occurs whenever the resistance to the flow of blood from the mesenteric venous circulation through or to the liver increases. The causes of portal hypertension are most commonly obstructive in nature. That is, there is an impediment to the forward flow of blood from the omphalomesenteric vascular bed through the liver and toward the heart. However, portal hypertension can also be caused by an increase in the volume of blood going to the liver or by a direct communication between the arterial and venous supplies to the liver that exposes the venous bed to abnormally high pressures.Portal hypertension may be defined as pressure in the portal venous bed that exceeds 5 to 8 cm H2O or a pressure gradient of more than 5 cm H2O between the hepatic veins and the portal circulation. When the pressure in the portal circulation exceeds those values, a series of physiologic changes leads to the symptoms common to all forms of portal hypertension, regardless of the cause.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323072557001082Portal HypertensionNaim Alkhouri, ... Vera F. Hupertz, in Pediatric Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease (Fourth Edition), 2011DiagnosisPortal hypertension should be considered in any patient presenting with hematemesis and unexplained splenomegaly. Evaluation should begin with careful examination of the child for signs of chronic liver disease, as well as for signs of other chronic organ dysfunction such as heart failure.Ultrasonography of the liver can uncover venous blockage of the prehepatic or posthepatic venous system, collaterals, liver echotexture abnormalities, and ascites. Doppler ultrasonography is useful for measurement of flow and determining the direction of flow. Ascites may have many causes aside from portal hypertension, and measurement of the serum:ascites albumin gradient (SAAG: serum albumin minus ascitic fluid albumin concentration) is a helpful way to predict portal hypertension (Figure 76-4). A SAAG greater than or equal to 1.1 g/dL is consistent with portal hypertension. Cardiac causes can also cause raised gradients but are associated with increased ascitic fluid albumin levels (greater than 2.5 g/dL), compared with low ascitic fluid albumin levels in patients with cirrhosis.66 Other causes of a high SAAG are alcoholic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, massive liver metastases, myxedema, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and mixed ascites.67 Other useful measurements done on ascites include the total white blood cell count, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, total protein and triglycerides.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) can detect the presence of esophageal and gastric varices as well as other causes of acute hemorrhage such as portal gastropathy. Several adult studies have tried to identify patients with varices by noninvasive or minimally invasive methods including biochemical parameters, ultrasound parameters, and capsule endoscopy.68-70 Two large multicenter trials have evaluated the role of capsule endoscopy as a minimally invasive tool for screening of esophageal varices.71,72 They demonstrated reasonable performance characteristics of capsule endoscopy; however, it was somewhat inferior to EGD, though patient compliance with capsule screening may be improved, especially in adolescent patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is useful for identifying biliary causes of intrahepatic portal hypertension.Transvenous insertion of a balloon catheter in the hepatic vein allows for measurement of the WHVP and FHVP. Risks include perforation and bleeding, but the procedure is fairly safe in experienced hands. Transient elastography is a novel and noninvasive method that measures liver tissue stiffness and has been shown to correlate strongly with HVPG.73,74 If validated in pediatric studies, this technique could be used to noninvasively evaluate the portal pressure and select patients at higher risk of having esophageal varices.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are complementary techniques that can evaluate the hepatic vasculature. These investigations are less operator dependent than ultrasonography, and they are noninvasive. They can be useful to demonstrate congenital hepatic vascular anomalies, vascular supply, portal vein thrombosis, and hepatic tumor localization, and also in assessing the patency of surgical shunts.75,76Testing for HPS includes contrast echocardiography, perfusion scans, oxygen saturation measurements with and without supplemental oxygen, transcutaneous hyperoxia testing,77 and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients. Simple echocardiography will show a normal heart. The injection of agitated saline (to introduce microbubbles) during echocardiography allows distinction between a person with no shunt, a cardiac shunt, or a pulmonary shunt. Macroaggregated albumin perfusion scanning is more specific and can confirm the diagnosis. Technetium-99-labeled microspheres (20 to 100 μm in diameter) are injected intravenously and should be completely removed by the lungs. If radioactivity is detected in extrapulmonary tissue, pathologic shunts are present.78Echocardiography is a noninvasive test for portopulmonary hypertension, producing estimates of pulmonary pressures. Right heart catheterization may be necessary in some unclear cases.41View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437707748100764Portal HypertensionLee M. Bass, Estella M. Alonso, in Pediatric Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease (Sixth Edition), 2021Surgical Therapy and Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic ShuntThere are several surgical options for the treatment of PHT. The clinician must decide carefully when to use these options versus TIPS, particularly within the context of future liver transplantation. In most circumstances, children with progressive liver disease who fail endoscopic therapies are best treated with liver transplantation. TIPS can be an effective bridge to transplantation, but surgical shunts should not be performed when it is expected that transplantation will be required within the following few years.Surgical shunting is a good option to treat complications resulting from noncirrhotic PHT, including idiopathic PHT, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and EHPVO. In the long term, surgical shunts control bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices in more than 90% of patients.215 Studies show that a significant number of patients with EHPVO have required shunt surgery.8,9,14 The maintenance of hepatopetal flow is very important in these procedures, as blood flow through the liver lowers the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (Fig. 76.6). Hepatopetal flow is maintained most consistently with a selective splenorenal shunt (distal splenorenal shunt; DSRS) or a partial small-caliber portocaval or mesocaval interposition shunt.215 The meso-Rex shunt is an excellent option for patients with EHPVO but requires normal liver architecture to ensure long-term patency.The meso-Rex bypass, or mesenteric-left portal vein bypass (MRB), uses a jugular venous autograft to shunt blood from the superior mesenteric vein into the intrahepatic portal vein at the Rex recessus (see Fig. 76.6). This has the advantage of shunting the blood around the obstruction and into the liver, thus restoring hepatopetal flow, decompressing varices, and reducing the size of the spleen. This operation was originally designed to treat acute portal vein thrombosis following OLT216,217 but has been most successfully used in patients with EHPVO of different etiologies.215 Preoperative imaging should be geared toward delineating the details of the EHPVO as well as the anatomy of the intrahepatic portal vein.218 The choice of anticoagulation following MRB may reduce the risk of postoperative bypass thrombosis; however, the role of thrombophilic risk factors in the development of shunt thrombosis is not clear.219 This procedure has been associated with excellent outcomes in terms of resolution of GI bleeding and increase in hematologic indices.220 Patients with EHPVO who have had the MRB have been shown to have significant improvement in growth parameters221 and improved neurocognitive function.222The DSRS, or Warren shunt, selectively compresses esophageal and gastric varices through the short gastric veins, spleen, and splenic vein to the left renal vein. It may take some time for the short gastric vessels and renal veins to accommodate the increased flow from the enlarged spleen and varices, but outcomes following selective shunt procedures are very good.223–225 Some groups have used partial portosystemic shunts with success215 and other types of selective shunts have been described including a splenoadrenal shunt.226 The type of shunt selected depends on the underlying pathology and vascular anatomy.Although all patients with EHPVO who have had selective shunt surgery and MRB have relief of bleeding, improvements in platelet count, INR, and serum ammonia are greater for MRB. Additionally, the improvement in weight for age is greater with MRB.227 Published guidelines and recent clinical reviews suggest that when feasible, the meso-Rex bypass should be considered in patients with clinically significant manifestations of EHPVO.215,225,228 The Baveno Pediatric Satellite Symposium on Portal Hypertension in 2015 stated that children with EHPVO should be offered MRB for primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding and other complications if appropriate surgical expertise is available, preoperative and intraoperative evaluation demonstrates favorable anatomy, and appropriate multidisciplinary care is available for postoperative evaluation and the management of shunt thrombosis or stenosis.184 The care team should plan this carefully, particularly since previous procedures to treat PHT negatively affect the success of MRB.229Splenectomy has been demonstrated to improve PHG in cirrhotic patients with PHT230 and has been demonstrated to improve abdominal discomfort and stabilize PHT in children with CF liver disease and massive splenomegaly.231 However, splenectomy is not recommended as a treatment for portal hypertensive hypersplenism in patients with a good long-term prognosis. Once splenectomy has been performed, the splenic vein cannot be used in any future shunt procedures and the patient is at risk for sepsis. Thus, splenectomy has been recommended only for cases of severe hypersplenism.215 Partial splenic embolization has been performed in children for treatment of hypersplenism due to PHT; however, it is rarely used because of side effects, which include severe pain, fever, and a systemic inflammatory response.232,233 Abscess formation in infarcted areas is a less common but well recognized complication.233,234 When used, embolization of 60% to 70% of the spleen is required for adequate reduction of the symptoms of hypersplenism.235 One group has described the use of shunt surgery combined with partial resection of the spleen in patients with EHPVO, enormous splenomegaly, and severe hypersplenism with resolution of hematologic indices and improvement in QOL, growth, and nutrition.236TIPS reduces elevated portal pressure by creating a communication between the hepatic and portal veins. TIPS is effective at reducing the portal pressure, can be placed by an interventional radiologist, and is technically feasible in children depending on the size of the child.237 To perform the procedure using a transjugular approach, the hepatic and portal veins are cannulated; then a guidewire is passed to connect the hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portal vein. Thereafter a stent is placed and the tract is dilated to reduce the portocaval pressure gradient as required (Fig. 76.7). In the past bare metal stents were used for the TIPS, but now polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stents have been utilized with a lower occlusion and reintervention rate in both adults238 and children.239,240 As compared with the procedure performed in adults, pediatric patients may require general anesthesia, a longer procedure time, and modification of the equipment. BA has been reported to increase difficulty with TIPS placement due to periportal fibrosis and small portal veins.241Indications for TIPS in pediatric patients have included recurrent variceal bleeding not responsive to more conservative therapy, hypersplenism, refractory ascites, BCS,242 veno-occlusive disease, malignancy, hepatorenal syndrome, and HPS.243–245 Several recent studies have demonstrated good results following TIPS in pediatric patients.246,247 In veno-occlusive disease, early TIPS insertion led to a reduction in the portosystemic pressure gradient and improvement in arterial and the majority portal flow to the liver, but it did not reduce the mortality rate, which remained extremely high due to multi–organ system failure.248 Current recommendations allow for TIPS as a therapeutic option if multi–organ system failure is not present.248Complications with TIPS placement include portal vein leakage, hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm, bile leak, hepatic encephalopathy, perforation, hemolysis, infection, and stent stenosis.246,249 Fever is common within the first 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and ALT levels may also rise immediately after the procedure and then return to baseline.250 Broad spectrum antibiotics should be utilized in the setting of emergency TIPS. Mortality from the procedure is low.Doppler ultrasonography should be performed 1 week after shunt placement and then after it as indicated by symptoms.251 If necessary, shunt revision can be performed using the transjugular approach for balloon angioplasty and shunt replacement. Historically, reinterventions were necessary in up to 50% of patients before more definitive surgery such as liver transplantation or surgical shunt placement could be implemented.252 However, with newer shunts, long-term patency is the rule rather than the exception. Shunt occlusion can be associated with rebleeding from esophageal varices post-TIPS. In adult studies, TIPS decreased blood flow through the sinusoids by up to 50% and can result in hepatic encephalopathy in up to 20% of adults who have underlying severe liver disease. Previous endoscopic therapy, age greater than 65 years, and Child’s class C are independent predictors of HE following TIPS in adults.253 Hepatic encephalopathy, usually transient, is less common but reported in children as well. Transient pulmonary edema secondary to a dramatic increase in preload has also been reported.Pediatric studies evaluating children with severe PHT who are unresponsive to β blockers and endoscopic treatment, who had esophageal bleeding, or who had severe refractory ascites demonstrate a high degree of resolution of symptoms with TIPS.252,254 However, hypersplenism is not reliably alleviated by TIPS.241View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323672931000761Cirrhosis and portal hypertensionRish K. Pai, Elizabeth M. Brunt, in Blumgart's Surgery of the Liver, Pancreas and Biliary Tract (Fifth Edition), 2012ConclusionLongstanding portal hypertension causes serious extrahepatic complications. Common presentations include esophageal varices with variceal bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy, congestive splenomegaly with hypersplenism, and ascites with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Portal hypertension also contributes to the development of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. In general, portal hypertension secondary to a noncirrhotic etiology has a better prognosis than portal hypertension caused by liver cirrhosis because of maintained synthetic function. Pathologic recognition of the characteristic morphologic features of many commonly encountered disorders underlying cirrhosis and noncirrhotic portal hypertension can aid in clinical management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437714548000709Portal Hypertensive BleedingCharanjit Virk, ... Navtej S. Buttar, in Clinical Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (Second Edition), 2012IntroductionPortal hypertension is a clinical syndrome defined as an increase in portal venous pressure greater than 5 mm Hg.1,2 It can arise from any condition interfering with the blood flow within the portal system. Among several complications of portal hypertension, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and renal insufficiency, variceal hemorrhage is the most dramatic with a high mortality. Under physiologic conditions, collaterals exist between the portal venous system and the systemic venous circulation; in portal hypertension, these collaterals enlarge in an attempt to decompress the portal circulation and form varices. This chapter focuses on the gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that results from portal hypertension; other complications of portal hypertension are reviewed separately.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437715293000130Portal Hypertension Related to BleedingPatrick S. Kamath, Vijay H. Shah, in Zakim and Boyer's Hepatology (Seventh Edition), 2018SplenomegalyPortal hypertension with varices and ascites can develop in patients with hematologic disease, such as polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis, and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. Rarely, Gaucher disease, leukemia, and lymphoma may also cause portal hypertension. These patients have increased portal venous blood flow, elevated portal venous pressure, and either normal or elevated WHVP, suggesting an element of increased intrahepatic resistance. If the portal hypertension is a result purely of increased portal venous blood flow, splenectomy should be curative. On the other hand, if there is significant intrahepatic resistance, splenectomy would not reverse the portal hypertension as is often the case. It is increasingly recognized that in patients with hematologic disease, nodular regenerative hyperplasia within the liver contributes to portal hypertension and is the cause of increased intrahepatic resistance.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323375917000161Pulmonary Arterial HypertensionLaura B. Kane, Joseph Loscalzo, in Vascular Medicine, 2006Portal HypertensionPortal hypertension is an important cause of PAH. Approximately 9% of patients with severe PAH are reported to have portal hypertension. Portopulmonary hypertension is defined as PAH associated with portal hypertension (portal pressure > 10 mm Hg), with or without hepatic disease. Because patients with nonhepatic causes of portal hypertension have been reported with this entity, it appears that it is the portal hypertension and not cirrhosis that triggers the development of PH. The mechanism of portopulmonary hypertension is unknown. Patients with portal hypertension may develop PH from an inability of the liver to metabolize serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The shear stress from increased pulmonary blood flow may result in endothelial injury, triggering a cascade of events that result in the characteristic adverse remodeling as described earlier.85PH affects 4% to 6% of patients referred for liver transplantation. Liver transplantation perioperative mortality is significantly increased in patients with a mean PAP greater than 35 mm Hg.86 The diagnosis of PH is usually made 4 to 7 years after the diagnosis of portal hypertension, but it has occasionally been reported to precede the onset of portal hypertension. The risk of PH increases with duration of disease. The correlation between the severity of portal hypertension and development of PH is debated. The female predominance of IPAH is not seen in portopulmonary hypertension. Survival is much worse than in PAH of other causes, with a median survival of 6 months.85View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780721602844500634Nonneoplastic Diseases of the StomachM. Kamionek, G.Y. Lauwers, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Portal hypertension gastropathyPortal hypertension gastropathy is an important cause of chronic, frequently occult, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and occurs in about 60% of all patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The presence of portal hypertension gastropathy correlates with the severity of liver disease and the presence and size of esophageal varices. Endoscopically, the mucosal appearance may range from a mild and nonspecific gastritis, to a more specific ‘snakeskin appearance,’ to a severe hemorrhagic gastritis. However, there is no good correlation between the endoscopic appearance and bleeding. Although pure increased hypertension in the portal venous system is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of this condition, changes in nitric oxide production, TNF-alpha synthesis, and sensitivity to prostaglandin inhibition also have been postulated to be involved. Similar changes have been observed in the setting of noncirrhotic portal hypertension and extraportal vein obstruction and in patients with Budd–Chiari syndrome. However, there is some evidence that portal hypertension gastropathy occurs more often with cirrhotic versus noncirrhotic causes of portal hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012386456703803XPortal Hypertension and Gastrointestinal BleedingVijay H. Shah, Patrick S. Kamath, in Sleisenger and Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease (Ninth Edition), 2010MalignancyPortal hypertension has been associated with leukemias, lymphomas, and systemic mastocytosis (see Chapters 34 and 35).140 Portal hypertension also may occur in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma independent of the presence of cirrhosis (see Chapter 94). The pathogenesis of portal hypertension in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is thought to be multifactorial; contributing factors include portal vein thrombosis, pressure by the tumor on the portal vein, and, in some cases, a hepatic artery–portal vein fistula. Esophageal varices may be seen in patients with hepatic metastases, although variceal bleeding is unusual.141View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416061892000901BILIARY TRACT DISORDERS AND PORTAL HYPERTENSIONAtsuyuki Yamataka MD, PhD, ... Takeshi Miyano MD, PhD, in Ashcraft's Pediatric Surgery (Fifth Edition), 2010Portal HypertensionPortal hypertension is common after portoenterostomy, even in infants with good bile flow. The basic inflammatory process affecting the extrahepatic ducts also damages the intrahepatic branches, albeit at variable rates. Continuing fibrosis has been demonstrated in some children despite successful portoenterostomy.91 Clinical manifestations of portal hypertension include esophageal variceal hemorrhage, hypersplenism, and ascites (Fig. 44-9). Of special note is the finding that, over time, the susceptibility to complications of portal hypertension seems to decrease, resulting in reduced frequency and severity of variceal bleeding. This observation is difficult to explain and may be related to improvement in hepatic histology or the development of spontaneous portosystemic shunts. In any case, this general observation justifies a nonsurgical approach to the management of portal hypertension, as long as hepatic function is preserved (i.e., the patient remains anicteric with no coagulopathy and normal serum albumin level). In the presence of poor hepatic function, however, complications of portal hypertension are an indication for liver transplantation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416061274000446Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of HepatologyJournalJournal of Vascular and Interventional RadiologyJournalGastroenterologyJournalGastrointestinal EndoscopyJournalBrowse books and journalsFeatured AuthorsInfo iconSanyal, Arun JayantVirginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, United StatesCitations81,965h-index134Publications240Bosch, JaumeUniversity Hospital Bern, Bern, SwitzerlandCitations53,963h-index126Publications249Trauner, MichaelMedizinische Universität Wien, Vienna, AustriaCitations37,964h-index98Publications195Ehman, Richard L.Mayo Medical School, Rochester, United StatesCitations28,503h-index88Publications65About ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

O’NeillJr. MD, in Ashcraft's Pediatric Surgery (Fifth Edition), 2010ETIOLOGYRenovascular hypertension may be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes include arterial hypoplasia or aplasia; neurofibromatosis involving the renal artery; and Williams syndrome, which includes manifestations of supravalvular aortic stenosis, peripheral vascular stenosis (particularly in the subclavian and renal arteries), hypercalcemia, and elfin facies.6 Renal involvement by tuberous sclerosis tumors has been reported as well. The most common acquired form of renovascular hypertension is fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which may be either localized to one or both renal arteries or appear as a more generalized type of disease, such as Takayasu’s arteritis and subisthmic abdominal coarctation, now more commonly referred to as the mid-aortic syndrome.7-9 In the mid-aortic syndrome, stenoses of visceral arteries such as the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries are common.8 Other less common forms of acquired renovascular hypertension are renal artery trauma or thrombosis, thrombosis secondary to antithrombin deficiency, Kawasaki disease, and an anastomotic stenosis, as is seen occasionally in renal transplants.10Overall, the vast majority of children with renovascular hypertension have what has been referred to as FMD or hyperplasia. Previous studies have suggested that this lesion has a congenital origin, but there is evidence to the contrary as well, because the disease appears to have an acquired pattern in young adults.6 FMD appears to coexist with neurofibromatosis, Williams syndrome, and pheochromocytoma. Because arterial and aortic hypoplasia and aplasia are seen in neonates, it is assumed that some of these lesions are congenital (Fig. 65-2).11 Conversely, the majority of patients are initially seen at several years of age, usually with an inflammatory phase followed by a quiescent phase of arteritis.4,7 Although it was initially thought that FMD might be an autoimmune disease, recent evidence suggests that T-cell–based immune mechanisms, macrophages, and antigen-presenting cells are mainly responsible for renovascular arteritis and a variety of other arteritides as well.12 The pathology of the vascular lesion seen in the renal artery and aorta reveals medial and perimedial fibroplasia, which has inherent implications about approaches to treatment, particularly angioplasty. Although FMD is a systemic, occlusive arteriopathy potentially involving the entire abdominal aorta and its branches, the renal arteries are the predominant vessels involved.13View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416061274000653Renovascular HypertensionSha-Ron Jackson MD, in The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook (Sixth Edition), 2008IX. SCREENING STUDIESThe 2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on Peripheral Artery Disease recommend screening for RAS only if a corrective procedure for RAS would be considered.A. LABORATORY STUDIES1.Captopril challenge test—plasma renin levels measured before and after administration of captopril accurately discriminate between renovascular and essential hypertension.2.Plasma renin activity profile—plasma renin plotted against 24-hour urine sodium excretion can identify right ventricular hypertrophy; however, plasma renin levels can be normal in up to 50% of patients with the disease.3.Obtain necessary serum and urine chemistries to rule out other potential causes of hypertension, for example, primary hyperaldosteronism (sodium, potassium), pheochromocytoma (urine catecholamines), hyperthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine), and hyperparathyroidism (calcium).B. DUPLEX ULTRASOUND1.Reliable, noninvasive method to detect RAS2.Peak systolic velocity is measured in the pararenal aorta and in each renal artery.3.A ratio of renal-to-aortic peak systolic velocities greater than 3.5 correlates with a significant (>60%) stenosis.4.Obesity, bowel gas, or recent surgery often prevents a technically adequate study.5.Often used for surveillance after angioplasty or surgeryC. INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM1.Widely used but highly inaccurate screening test2.Renovascular hypertension is suspected if there is a difference of ≥1.5 cm in renal length or if there is a delay in the appearance of contrast material on one side.3.Up to 30% of patients with renovascular hypertension demonstrate no abnormal findings.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416048954500470Renovascular HypertensionJagajan Karmacharya MD, ... Jeffrey P. Carpenter MD, in Penn Clinical Manual of Urology, 2007XII CONCLUSIONS1.Failed medical management in new-onset HTN should be aggressively treated by enodovascular techniques or open surgery.2.Surgical revascularization can improve BP control and renal function in selected patients in up to 90% of cases of renal HTN.3.PTA provides success rates somewhat inferior to the results for atherosclerotic lesions but is the treatment of choice for RVH secondary to fibrodysplastic lesions.4.PTA or PTAS has increased in popularity and is the current procedure of choice.5.Open procedures are reserved for patients not amenable to percutaneous methods.SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS1.What is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension?2.What is the workup for patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension?3.What is the initial management?4.What are the indications for referral to a vascular specialist?5.What are the current revascularization techniques?View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416038481100245Renal HypertensionDaniele Cusi, in Encyclopedia of Endocrine Diseases (Second Edition), 2019Renal Sodium Handling Along the Nephron and Blood Pressure RegulationSodium homeostasis depends on the intrinsic capacity of the kidney to produce glomerular ultrafiltrate and on its ability to reabsorb salt at different levels along the nephron. Due to their complex regulation, the renal epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are a major player of sodium balance. Located in the cortical collecting duct, they are under renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system control. The complex interplay of the system depends from the fact that Angiotensin II is produced as a response to decreased renal oxygen tension or decreased perfusion pressure. Angiotensin II production aims to bring back BP to its normal value, causing vasoconstriction, increasing sympathetic nerve activity and myocardial contractility. Angiotensin II also directly stimulates aldosterone production that induces the synthesis of ENaC subunits that assemble in channels in the plasma membrane or by increasing the probability that the channels are open permitting the passage (reabsorption) of sodium (Fuller and Young, 2005).As renal sodium handling plays a crucial role in BP regulation, the systems involved in sodium handling and the underlying genetic mechanisms have been object of research for many years for understanding their roles in sodium homeostasis and salt sensitivity.While there is no doubt that a positive salt balance plays a fundamental role in renal hypertension, other factors as the activation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) (Rassler, 2010), increased production of endothelin (Elijovich and Laffer, 2002), and endogenous digitalis-like substance (Blaustein et al., 2009); reduced generation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (Raij, 1999) and kinins (Mamenko et al., 2014).Family studies estimated heritability of salt-sensitive phenotype from moderate to high (Gu et al., 2007; Svetkey et al., 1996), with large difference between different studies, probably due at least in part to differences in ethnicities. Whatever the case, elucidation of the genetic contribution to BP salt sensitivity provides important information on how polymorphism in the genes controlling sodium reabsorption interact with sodium intake influencing individual BP value. Dissecting Mendelian forms of BP variation where mutations in single genes impart large effects on BP helped to identify fundamental pathways which could affect BP in humans (Fig. 3; Lifton et al., 2001). While the figure summarizes only the diseases of Na reabsorption inherited in Mendelian forms (hypertensive disorders in red and hypotensive disorders in blue), a large number of proteins performing or controlling renal Na transport or other proteins controlling hormone synthesis or release affecting sodium transport became candidates for genomic research since they took part to the same physiological pathway. The list of candidate genes associate to hypertension is very long but provided however inconsistent results (Basson et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2016) except for the face that the vast majority of the positive findings was pointing to renal mechanisms.Fig. 3. Schematic representation of a nephron. The molecular pathways mediating NaCl reabsorption in individual renal cells in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL), distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and the cortical collecting tubule (CCT) are indicated, along with the pathway of the renin–angiotensin system, the major regulator of renal salt reabsorption. Inherited diseases affecting these pathways are indicated, with hypertensive disorders in red and hypotensive disorders in blue.

In spite of a tremendous effort spent by large consortia involving tents of groups worldwide and typing thousands of individuals along the genome, also in this case, despite the increasing pace of discovery of variants associated with BP, CKD, and HTN, the utility of the discoveries seems limited, with the sole exception of the UMOD gene.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383643301Volume 1John E. Hall, ... Michael E. Hall, in Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney (Fifth Edition), 2013Renovascular HypertensionRenovascular hypertension, although accounting for only 2–3% of all hypertension, is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. The pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension is due to an initial reduction in renal perfusion that occurs as a result of stenosis of the main renal artery, one of its branches or stenosis/injury of other smaller preglomerular blood vessels and glomeruli. The majority of renal vascular lesions reflect either fibromuscular dysplasia or atherosclerosis.114 The predominant lesion found in the main renal artery or its branches in patients older than 50 years of age is atherosclerotic disease. More subtle functional constriction or structural changes in smaller blood vessels (e.g., afferent arterioles, glomeruli) are difficult to detect clinically, but can contribute to increased BP.Renovascular hypertension can be unilateral or bilateral, and can result in a homogeneous or non-homogeneous ischemia of nephrons. As discussed earlier in the chapter, there are some important differences in the pathophysiology of homogeneous compared to non-homogenous impairments of renal perfusion. Experimental counterparts of these two clinical forms of renovascular hypertension can be found in the 1-kidney, 1-clip and the 2-kidney, 1-clip models of Goldblatt hypertension, respectively.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123814623000392Systemic HypertensionMyung K. Park MD, FAAP, FACC, in Park's Pediatric Cardiology for Practitioners (Sixth Edition), 2014Diagnostic WorkupWhen renovascular hypertension is a possible cause, one generally needs most of the investigations listed earlier (see Table 28-4) except for endocrine tests.1.BUN and creatinine are usually normal in renovascular hypertension unless there is severe renal artery involvement or accelerated hypertension.2.There may be some hypokalemia caused by secondary hyperaldosteronism.3.It is not uncommon to find a normal size and shape of the kidneys in renal ultrasonography.4.PRA is increased in most (but not all) cases of patients with renovascular disease or pyelonephritic scarring. ACE inhibitors stimulate PRA selectively in patients with renovascular hypertension (“captopril-stimulated PRA test”), but the specificity of the test is controversial. Low PRA in a hypertensive child suggests mineralocorticoid excess or a salt and water overload for other reasons.5.Renal vein renin measurement is an important diagnostic procedure and helps in identifying surgically curable forms of renal hypertension.6.Doppler ultrasonography, CT angiography, and MR angiography are safe tests with high sensitivity and specificity for renovascular hypertension. However, renal arteriography is still considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. The procedure is mandatory if surgical or transluminal angioplasty is being considered.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323169516000289Renovascular Hypertension and Ischemic NephropathyStephen C. Textor, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease (Third Edition), 2018Clinical ManifestationsRVH and ischemic nephropathy are diagnosed primarily by recognition of a clinical syndrome consistent with these disorders, particularly progressive or secondary hypertension with or without unexplained chronic kidney disease (CKD). Occlusive RVD is expressed across a range of manifestations generally related to the severity and/or duration of vascular occlusion, as illustrated in Fig. 13.1. Many incidental lesions are now identified during imaging procedures for other indications, including computed tomography (CT) and/or MR angiography. It should be emphasized that hemodynamic effects of lumen occlusion such as changes in either translesional pressure or flow are barely detectable until lumen occlusion reaches a “critical level” in the vicinity of 70% to 80% lumen occlusion.22 Studies in humans subjected to stepwise partial balloon obstruction of the renal artery indicate that gradients of at least 10% to 20% reductions in postobstruction pressures are required to detect measurable renin release.23 An important corollary is that failure to identify a pressure gradient across such a vascular lesion makes it unlikely that renal revascularization will have detectable hemodynamic benefits.Clinical characteristics of atherosclerotic RVH include rapid changes in arterial pressure, often in subjects with preexisting hypertension (Table 13.2). The average age of recent interventional reports for RVH is above 70 years. Arterial pressure rises with age in Western societies, so the majority of these individuals will have previously identified hypertension. Recognizing recent progression and rising antihypertensive drug requirements should raise the question of a superimposed secondary process such as atherosclerotic RVH. As compared with essential hypertension, patients with RVH have more evident activation of the renin-angiotensin system and increased sympathetic nerve activation, sometimes associated with wide pressure fluctuations and variability. Clinical findings suggestive of RVH as opposed to essential hypertension are listed in Table 13.3. Target organ manifestations including vascular injury, left ventricular hypertrophy, and renal dysfunction are more common with RVH as compared with age-matched subjects with essential hypertension of similar levels.24Based on clinical features alone, some authors indicate that a scoring system based on age, gender, smoking history, recent onset of hypertension, and elevated serum creatinine allows excellent estimates of pretest probability of identifying renovascular lesions.25The presence of occlusive RVD and RVH can accelerate manifestations of other vascular disease. Impaired volume control related to RVD worsens circulatory congestion associated with left-ventricular dysfunction. When RVD triggers additional rises in arterial pressure, the resulting left-ventricular outflow resistance can precipitate congestive heart failure, sometimes designated “flash” pulmonary edema.26,27 This is a recognizable clinical syndrome and is often associated with rapid worsening of renal function as arterial pressure is lowered and/or diuresis is achieved. Observational series report higher rates of mortality and rehospitalization for patients with combined congestive heart failure and RVD.28,29Ultimately, progressive atherosclerotic RVD leads to loss of kidney function in the affected kidney(s). Prospective trials including ASTRAL (Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions) and CORAL (Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions) indicate that 15% to 22% of subjects with RVD progress to a renal “endpoint” over a follow-up period between 3 and 4 years.30 As a practical matter, establishing whether this progression poses a clinical problem in a specific individual is often the central element in management of atherosclerotic RVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323429733000135Laboratory evaluation of endocrine hypertensionWilliam E. Winter, Neil S. Harris, in Handbook of Diagnostic Endocrinology (Third Edition), 2021Renovascular hypertension (mechanism 1a1)Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is hypertension that results from impaired macro or microvascular flow to the kidney [74]. RVH has many causes as listed in Table 11.3. Evidence of renovascular disease should be sought when there is resistant hypertension, hypertension of abrupt onset, or worsening or increasingly difficult to control hypertension, severe, acute-onset pulmonary edema, or early-onset hypertension. Renovascular disease should also be considered when the physical examination reveals abdominal bruits (a sound heard with a stethoscope produced by turbulent blood flow through an artery).Renal ischemia then elicits elevated renin and subsequent elevations in ANG II and aldosterone. Secondary hyperaldosteronism can also be caused by nonvascular renal (parenchymal) disease.Renal ultrasound is a screening test for renal (parenchymal) disease in pediatrics. For renovascular disease, renal duplex Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning are screening tests. Renal angiography (bilateral selective renal intraarterial angiography) is a confirmatory test for renovascular disease. If renal artery stenosis is diagnosed, pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy should be initiated. If such medical therapy fails or the stenosis is not due to atherosclerosis (e.g., fibromuscular dysplasia), percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and/or stent placement can be considered [75]. Surgical revascularization is not superior to medical therapy [76].Obviously, RVH is not a primary endocrine disorder. However, because the mechanism of hypertension is renin-induced activation of the RAAS, the topic is included for completeness.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012818277200011XDermatologic Drug Therapy in ChildrenKelly M. Cordoro, Anita N. Haggstrom, in Comprehensive Dermatologic Drug Therapy (Fourth Edition), 2021Adverse Effects and MonitoringRenal toxicity and hypertension are potential AE of long-term CSA use. Its use is typically limited to 1 year of continuous treatment in the United States (and 2 years in Europe). Pediatric trials indicate that renal toxicity and hypertension may be rarer in children than in adults.68,70,71Serious infections in the setting of monotherapy for skin disease are possible but rare. Commonly reported short-term AE include headaches and GI upset. Risks associated with high-dose CSA used in the context of multidrug organ transplantation regimens, such as hypertrichosis, paresthesias, arthralgias, and gingival hyperplasia, seem less common in children treated for skin disease.72 Lymphoproliferative malignancies observed in the transplant population have not been observed in children on short-term, low-dose monotherapy.Before and during treatment with CSA, evaluation of complete blood count, serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood chemistries and blood pressure is advisable. Administration of live virus vaccines is contraindicated during CSA treatment.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032361211100070XRecommended publicationsInfo iconAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAnnals of Vascular SurgeryJournalJournal of Vascular and Interventional RadiologyJournalKidney InternationalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Vidt, in Hypertension (Second Edition), 2005Accelerated or Malignant HypertensionMalignant hypertension constitutes a syndrome of severe elevations of mean arterial pressure (MAP) often to or exceeding 140 mm Hg, manifested clinically by retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and papilledema. The term malignant hypertension was formerly reserved for those patients who exhibited advanced funduscopic changes, including papilledema, whereas the term accelerated hypertension was used when the syndrome was observed without papilledema.The distinction between accelerated and malignant hypertension has been deemphasized because the short- and long-term prognoses are independent of the presence or absence of papilledema, and both the pathogenesis and clinical management of accelerated and malignant hypertension are the same.7,8 In addition, the presence of papilledema may be difficult to detect on funduscopic examination and is subject to observer interpretation.9Vascular damage is believed to relate both to the duration and severity of the elevated MAP. Untreated or inadequately treated essential hypertension represents the most common antecedent of malignant hypertension and has been observed to be more common among smokers.10 With improved hypertension control efforts, progression to the malignant phase of hypertension is seen less commonly. Secondary etiologies of hypertension are more prevalent among patients who do progress to accelerated or malignant hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978072160258550168XEssential HypertensionTheodore L. Goodfriend, Kristin M. Lyerly, in Pathophysiology of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, 2009D The Kidney in Malignant HypertensionMalignant hypertension is defined as a rapidly increasing pressure (also called accelerated hypertension) with severe, sudden damage to the brain, the eyes, and the kidneys. Several histologic manifestations of inflammation and necrosis characterize malignant hypertension and differentiate it from nonmalignant hypertension:1.Fibrinoid necrosis of the arterioles occurs. Fibrinoid is a term that is given to an eosin-staining substance, fi brin, that is extruded into the blood vessel wall under the extreme pressures of malignant hypertension (Fig. 15-4).2.In malignant hypertension, the glomeruli may show areas of thrombosis and areas of necrosis. The hemorrhages into the kidney parenchyma cause the spotty, red, “flea-bitten” appearance of the surface.3.The arteriolar and arterial lesions result in the considerable narrowing of all vascular lumina, with ischemia and infarctions distal to the abnormal vessels.The question of cause and effect enters into all discussions of renal pathology in hypertension, whether benign or malignant. Diseases of the renal arteries can cause hypertension either by impairing sodium excretion, by stimulating renin release, or both. In turn, the hypertension itself damages renal vessels, so there is a vicious cycle. In malignant hypertension, the vascular damage is acute, and renin release is a very important part of the pressure increase. In benign, essential hypertension, vascular damage is chronic, and its most important pressure-raising influence is sodium retention.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416043911500217Secondary HyperaldosteronismAleksander Prejbisz, Andrzej Januszewicz, in Encyclopedia of Endocrine Diseases (Second Edition), 2019Malignant HypertensionMalignant hypertension (MHT), also known as accelerated-malignant hypertension or malignant phase hypertension is defined clinically as high blood pressure associated with bilateral retinal flame-shaped hemorrhages, exudates or cotton wool spots, with or without papilledema. It is the most severe form of hypertension. It has been also proposed to replace the term “malignant hypertension” with “hypertensive crisis with retinopathy.” Since the presence of retinopathy may allow other target organs to be included, making the description of this type of hypertensive emergency more accurate (Kaplan and Victor, 2015; Mancia et al., 2013; van den Born et al., 2011; Januszewicz et al., 2016).MHT is associated with failure of blood pressure autoregulation and develops when the mean arterial pressure (diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 of the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) reaches a critical level of 150 mmHg, as reported in experimental animals. Fibrinoid necrosis appears in the arterial walls, which may be caused by vasoactive factor(s) or may be a nonspecific consequence of very high BP (Kaplan and Victor, 2015; Januszewicz et al., 2016).Possible pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of MHT have been proposed. These include: rapidly increasing blood pressure, pressure diuresis and natriuresis, severe renal vasoconstriction and ischemia. Moreover, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, microangiopathy, hemolytic anemia and development of retinopathy are found in MHT. The vascular lesions of MHT consist of fibrinoid necrosis and myointimal proliferation (Januszewicz et al., 2016).Various symptoms and complications may accompany MHT, the most typical being microangiopathic lesions or renal failure. In some patients, the presenting manifestation may be an acute oliguric renal failure. In patients with MHT many features of renal dysfunction, including microalbuminuria, proteinuria, may be also present. About half of patients with MHT may have hypokalemia, reflecting secondary aldosteronism from increased renin secretion induced by intrarenal ischemia. Hyponatremia is also common (Kaplan and Victor, 2015; Januszewicz et al., 2016).Since MHT is a hypertensive emergency, patients with MHT should receive immediate antihypertensive treatment, under continuous supervision, preferably in an intensive care setting, due to a high risk of renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure (Januszewicz et al., 2016).The 2013 Guidelines on hypertension from the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and ESC recommend treatment based on agents that can be administered by intravenous infusion and titrated according to response, lowering blood pressure gradually, avoiding abrupt falls in BP and excessive hypotension (Mancia et al., 2013).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383661494Normal Blood Pressure Control and the Evaluation of HypertensionWilliam J. Lawton, ... Gerald F. DiBona, in Comprehensive Clinical Nephrology (Fourth Edition), 2010Accelerated Hypertension/Hypertensive Urgencies and EmergenciesAccelerated hypertension is severe diastolic hypertension (usually >120 mm Hg) in the presence of grade III retinopathy (arteriolosclerotic changes of arteriolar narrowing and nicking plus hypertensive changes of flame-shaped hemorrhages and soft exudates).29 In the past, “malignant” hypertension referred to severe diastolic hypertension and grade IV retinopathy (grade III plus papilledema). Because the prognosis for untreated severe hypertension with grade III or IV retinopathy is so poor, there is little clinical rationale for using the two terms separately. More recently, accelerated hypertension with hypertensive retinopathy is defined as a hypertensive urgency if treatment is required to decrease BP within hours, whereas hypertensive emergencies are clinical conditions in which severe hypertension must be lowered within minutes. Emergencies include acute dissection of the aorta, acute left ventricular failure, intracerebral hemorrhage, and crises caused by pheochromocytoma, drug abuse, and eclampsia (see Chapter 36).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323058766000320Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Malignant HypertensionMalignant hypertension is characterized by markedly elevated pressures with hypertensive neuroretinopathy. Funduscopic examination reveals acute vasculitis manifested by flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, or papilledema. Other findings include nephropathy, encephalopathy, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and cardiac ischemia. Without treatment, malignant hypertension results in a greater than 90% 1-year mortality rate. In the classic series by Kincaid-Smith (1980), deaths from untreated malignant hypertension resulted from renal failure (19%), congestive heart failure (13%), renal failure plus congestive heart failure (48%), stroke (20%), and myocardial infarction (1%).The primary goal is to reduce BP while preserving target organs at risk. The autoregulatory range of cerebral blood flow is increased in chronic hypertension, but the lower limit remains approximately 25% below the resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients with both normotension and chronic hypertension. Symptoms of low cerebral blood flow include nausea, yawning, hyperventilation, clamminess, and syncope. After initial reduction of BP by 20% within the first hour, BP is further reduced over the next 2 to 6 hours to the 160/110 mm Hg range as long as there is no evidence of alterations in cerebral perfusion. Nitroprusside is the most useful intravenous agent for hypertensive crises. Since malignant hypertension is associated with intravascular volume depletion, nitroprusside should be started at low doses and titrated slowly (0.25 μg/kg/min or less with titration every 3 to 5 minutes). Alternatives to nitroprusside include labetalol, fenoldopam, and nicardipine. Rebound hypertension can occur if parental therapy is terminated early. Oral therapy is started after the pressure has been stabilized on parenteral therapy. Parenteral therapy is then slowly removed and oral therapy titrated to maintain BP control.Renal failure is common with malignant hypertension and may exacerbate the hypertension (Fig. 32.5). Fibrinoid necrosis develops in afferent arterioles, and proliferative endarteritis develops in interlobular arteries. As a result, the vessel lumen becomes narrowed, resulting in decreased renal blood flow. The arteriolopathy of malignant hypertension results in fixed anatomic lesions so that when the BP is initially lowered the creatinine may increase. Renal function begins to improve after several weeks of therapy in most patients and may continue to improve for up to 26 months. Of the patients who require dialysis, 50% regain sufficient function to discontinue dialysis. Recovery of renal function is more likely when the combined length of both kidneys is 20.2 cm or more and less likely when the kidney length is 14.2 cm or less. If renal failure is secondary to malignant hypertension, adequate BP control may reverse renal failure. However, when malignant hypertension is secondary to underlying kidney disease (e.g., glomerulonephritis), the primary renal disease may cause progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) regardless of BP control. In the past, nitroprusside has been the preferred agent to treat hypertension and renal failure. The metabolism of nitroprusside results in the production of cyanide, which is taken up by red blood cells and conjugated to thiocyanate in the liver. Cyanide toxicity occurs in patients with anemia or liver disease, whereas thiocyanate toxicity is seen in the setting of renal disease. Thiocyanate levels should be monitored and the duration of therapy kept to less than 72 hours whenever possible. Alternatively, both fenoldopam and labetalol have no toxic metabolites and may protect renal function.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Clinical biochemistry of the cardiovascular systemClodagh M. Loughrey, Ian S. Young, in Clinical Biochemistry: Metabolic and Clinical Aspects (Third Edition), 2014Malignant hypertensionMalignant hypertension is defined as markedly elevated blood pressure (diastolic BP often > 140 mmHg) with retinal haemorrhages, exudates or papilloedema with or without evidence of target organ damage, typically acute and progressive kidney injury with proteinuria and haematuria (‘malignant nephrosclerosis’). Its management is a medical emergency and should take precedence over investigations to determine whether there is an underlying cause. Neurological signs in malignant hypertension may be due to intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage or lacunar infarct, or to hypertensive encephalopathy. The latter is associated with insidious onset and non-lateralizing symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, restlessness, confusion. It may be confirmed radiologically on the basis of MRI, which shows oedema of the white matter in the occipito-parietal regions, termed ‘reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy’. (The distinction is important as hypertensive encephalopathy mandates aggressive reduction of blood pressure, not usually indicated for haemorrhage or infarct.)View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702051401000389Renal System and Urinary TractRobert G. Carroll PhD, in Elsevier's Integrated Physiology, 2007Transcapillary Fluid ExchangeFluid movement at each capillary bed depends on the balance of fluid pressures and osmotic pressures (Fig. 11-7 and Table 11-1). Glomerular capillary blood pressure reflects resistance to flow at afferent and efferent arterioles. Preglomerular (primarily afferent arteriole) constriction decreases flow of blood into the glomerular capillaries and decreases glomerular capillary blood pressure. Postglomerular (primarily efferent arteriole) constriction decreases the flow of blood out of the glomerulus and increases glomerular capillary pressure.Glomerular capillary blood pressure reflects the opposing influence of afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance (see Fig. 11-7). Afferent arteriolar constriction increases vascular resistance and decreases glomerular capillary pressure. Activation of renal sympathetic nerves constricts preferentially the afferent arteriole. Efferent arteriolar constriction increases vascular resistance and increases glomerular capillary pressure. The efferent arteriolar smooth muscle is particularly sensitive to the vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin II.Peritubular capillary blood pressure reflects the influence of preperitubular vessel constriction. Afferent arteriolar constriction decreases renal blood flow and decreases peritubular capillary pressure. Efferent arteriolar constriction decreases renal blood flow and decreases peritubular capillary pressure. Peritubular capillary blood pressure represents the combined influence of afferent and efferent arteriolar constriction (Fig. 11-8).Plasma oncotic pressure is due to the presence of albumin and other large molecular proteins that cannot freely cross the capillary wall. At the glomerulus, an ultrafiltrate of plasma enters Bowman's capsule, but albumin remains in the glomerular capillaries. Consequently, glomerular filtration causes an increase in the oncotic pressure of blood exiting the glomerular capillaries.The increase in oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries can reduce the net filtration pressure in the glomerulus. For example, in hypotensive shock, there is a reduced rate of renal blood flow. In this case, GFR is reduced because of the combined reduction in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and the low flow—induced increase in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure. Conversely, if glomerular blood flow (per minute) is high, the volume filtered (per milliliter of blood) decreases, attenuating the normal increase in plasma oncotic pressure and increasing GFR. If the glomerular barrier is damaged so that the glomerular capillaries become permeable to albumin, the normal reabsorptive oncotic force is diminished and GFR is increased.The oncotic pressure in Bowman's capsule usually is 0 because the ultrafiltrate in Bowman's capsule does not contain much albumin. The interstitial fluid oncotic pressure is low around the peritubular capillaries because of the small amount of albumin that is present in the interstitial fluid.The filtration coefficient reflects restriction on movement of particles into the ultrafiltrate (Fig. 11-9). The negatively charged basement membrane hinders filtration of negatively charged proteins and represents the major impediment to filtration. In addition, capillary endothelial pores and podocyte (Bowman's capsule epithelium) pores and fibers of the basement membrane restrict movement based on molecular weight.The filtration coefficient is variable, and it changes in some disease states. A decreased pore size is caused by contraction of endothelial cells. Endothelial contraction can be caused by angiotensin II, norepinephrine, prostaglandins, and bradykinin. Diseases that cause a thickening of the basement membrane also diminish filtration.PATHOLOGY Malignant HypertensionMalignant hypertension is characterized by a progressive increase in blood pressure over a short time. Plasma angiotensin II levels rise in concert with the increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin is not the cause of the hypertension, but rather the angiotensin II constriction of the efferent arteriole helps preserve glomerular filtration and renal function during this disease process.A loss of the negative charges on basement membrane, such as by glycosylation of the basement membrane proteins or by antigen-antibody reactions, allows some proteins to pass into the urine (proteinuria). Two common causes of proteinuria are diabetes and streptococcal infection.PATHOLOGY Poststreptococcal GlomerulonephrosisAbout 7 days after a streptococcal infection, the kidneys exhibit glomerulonephrosis. The increase in urine volume and protein excretion in the urine are caused by destruction of the glomerular basement membranes by antibodies generated in response to the infection.In summary, fluid movement across the capillary is based on the combination of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. Filtration occurs at the glomerular capillaries owing to the high capillary pressure and the normal oncotic pressure. Consequently, 20% of the plasma that enters the kidney is filtered. Reabsorption occurs at the peritubular capillaries owing to the lower capillary pressure and the higher plasma oncotic pressure. For this reason, 80% to 99.5% of ultrafiltrate formed in the glomerulus is reabsorbed.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323043182500170Hypertensive RetinopathyALEX MELAMUD MA, MD, PETER K. KAISER MD, in Retinal Imaging, 200628.2.2 HYPERTENSIVE CHOROIDOPATHYMalignant hypertension causes fibrinoid necrosis of the choriocapillaris with corresponding atrophy of the outer retina and necrosis of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). On funduscopic examination, areas of the RPE overlying occluded choriocapillaris appear as patchy yellow lesions (Figure 28-15). With time, the RPE becomes hyperpigmented with a surrounding halo of hypopigmentation (Elschnig's spots). These changes are most prominent in the mid-periphery and around the optic nerve. In chronic hypertension, RPE overlying choroidal vessels undergoes hypertrophy and hyperpigmentation, leading to linear configurations known as Siegrist's streaks. Leakage from incompetent choroidal vessels accumulates under the neurosensory retina and RPE, producing localized bullous serous detachments (Figures 28-16 and 28-17).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323023467500338Hypertensive CrisisPhilip Shayne, Catherine A. Lynch, in Emergency Medicine (Second Edition), 2013Accelerated-Malignant HypertensionAccelerated-malignant hypertension occurs most commonly in young African American males with underlying renal parenchymal disease or renovascular disease. It is most commonly found in patients with long-standing hypertension and usually occurs without encephalopathy.10 When endothelial vasodilator responses are overwhelmed, further hypertension and endothelial damage occur and lead to inflammatory vasculopathy. Marked elevation in blood pressure and characteristic eyeground findings make the diagnosis. Flame-shaped hemorrhages develop around the optic disk because of the high intravascular pressure, and soft exudates are caused by ischemic infarction of the nerve fibers secondary to occlusion of the supplying arterioles. Common symptoms include headache (85%), visual blurring (55%), nocturia (38%), and weakness (30%). Laboratory evidence includes azotemia, proteinuria, hematuria, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Papilledema is considered the sine qua non of malignant hypertension. Accelerated hypertension is used to describe the same condition (hemorrhages and exudates) without papilledema. Because the absence of papilledema does not connote a different clinical prognosis or therapy, the term accelerated-malignant hypertension is now recommended.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437735482000690Specific Pharmacologic Approaches to Clinical RenoprotectionIn Pocket Companion to Brenner and Rector's The Kidney (Eighth Edition), 2011HypertensionWhereas malignant hypertension has long been recognized to lead to rapid loss of renal function, the role of less severe hypertension in progressive renal damage is not as clearly defined. Epidemiologic data on patients entering dialysis suggest a substantial role for hypertension, with hypertensive nephrosclerosis being the second most common cause of end-stage renal failure, surpassed only by diabetes. Among patients with a diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis, however, only 6% had a history of malignant hypertension, a finding that strongly suggests a causal role for less severe hypertension in the development of end-stage renal failure. In addition, large epidemiologic screening investigations have found blood pressure (BP), specifically diastolic BP, to be a predictor of end-stage renal disease in the general population. Remarkably, in some studies the association with increased renal risk is already apparent with systolic and diastolic pressures well within the normotensive range. Although hypertension is very common, the development of renal failure is a rare event. This suggests the impact of BP on long-term renal function depends on the concomitant presence of either a specific susceptibility to hypertensive renal damage or the presence of other renal risk factors (or a combination thereof). Several predictors of loss of renal function have been identified in hypertensive populations, including racial factors, impaired glucose tolerance, increased uric acid levels, and elevated serum creatinine.In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension is common, and its prevalence increases with deteriorating renal function. Hypertension is consistently associated with a poor renal outcome in CKD. In diabetic patients, the development of hypertension is closely associated with the transition from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria, with subsequent progression to overt proteinuria, and with progressive loss of renal function. Likewise, in nondiabetic renal disease, hypertension is associated with a poor long-term renal outcome across a spectrum of renal disorders.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416066408000324Recommended publicationsInfo iconKidney InternationalJournalJournal of Vascular SurgeryJournalInternational Journal of CardiologyJournalBloodJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Messerli, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESISHypertensive emergency can develop de novo or can complicate underlying essential or secondary hypertension.3 Renal parenchymal diseases accounts for up to 80% of all secondary causes, with chronic pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis being the most common diagnoses. The factors that lead to the severe and rapid BP elevation in patients with hypertensive emergency are poorly understood. The rapidity of onset suggests a triggering factor superimposed on preexisting hypertension. The release of humoral vasoconstrictor substances from the stressed vessel wall is thought to be responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of the hypertensive emergency. Mild to moderate increase in BP does not affect target-organ perfusion because of the autoregulatory mechanisms. However, severe BP elevation above the autoregulatory threshold leads to transmission of the pressure to small distal vessels, causing endothelial injury. The endothelial dysfunction leads to increased vascular wall permeability, cell proliferation, and activation of the coagulation cascade and platelets, resulting ultimately in fibrinoid necrosis of small blood vessels, release of vasoconstrictor substances, and tissue ischemia. The initial vascular damage leads to a vicious cycle of further vascular injury, tissue ischemia, and release of more vasoconstrictor substances. Renal ischemia causes activation of the renin angiotension system that plays a central role in the initiation and perpetuation of the vascular injury characteristic to hypertensive emergency. In addition to activation of the renin–angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, and catecholamines are postulated to play important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertensive emergencies.6View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500660AntihypertensivesMary Anna Labato DVM, DACVIM, in Small Animal Critical Care Medicine, 2009Treatment of Hypertensive EmergencyHypertensive emergencies should be treated at facilities that provide 24-hour critical care.

These patients should be treated quickly and require monitoring in a critical care facility.11,21 According to the current recommendations for people as outlined in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, the initial goal of therapy in hypertensive emergencies is to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by no more than 25% (within minutes to 1 hour); then, if the patient's condition is stable, to reduce blood pressure to 160/100 to 160/110 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours. Excessive falls in pressure that may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia should be avoided.6Treatment of Hypertensive EmergencyHypertensive emergencies should be treated at facilities that provide 24-hour critical care. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is imperative, preferably using direct arterial pressure monitoring, although indirect methods are also acceptable (see Chapter 183). Potentially dangerous medications such as nitroprusside and hydralazine may be used. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent arterial and venous dilator that may begin to act in seconds and has a half-life of 2 to 3 minutes. It needs to be administered as a constant rate infusion. Hydralazine is a rapid arteriolar dilator with unpredictable effects and has been associated with profound episodes of hypotension.1 Nicardipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking agent, is another fast-acting, injectable antihypertensive agent with minimal cardiac effects.Enalaprilat is a parenteral ACE inhibitor similar in action to enalapril; however, it is fast acting. It is used in hypertensive emergencies. The dosage in human medicine is 0.625 to 1.25 mg intravenously over 5 minutes q6h. The dosage has been extrapolated for use in veterinary medicine, and the author uses 0.1 to 1.0 mg q6h intravenously.37View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455703067001598Arterial hypertension, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and heart failureKevin M. O'Shaughnessy, in Clinical Pharmacology (Eleventh Edition), 2012Sodium nitroprussideis a highly effective antihypertensive agent when given intravenously. Its effect is almost immediate and lasts for 1–5 min. Therefore it must be given by a precisely controllable infusion. It dilates both arterioles and veins, which would cause collapse were the patient to stand up, e.g. for toilet purposes. There is a compensatory sympathetic discharge with tachycardia and tachyphylaxis to the drug.The action of nitroprusside is terminated by metabolism within erythrocytes. Specifically, electron transfer from haemoglobin iron to nitroprusside yields methaemoglobin and an unstable nitroprusside radical. This breaks down, liberating cyanide radicals capable of inhibiting cytochrome oxidase (and thus cellular respiration). Fortunately, most of the cyanide remains bound within erythrocytes but a small fraction does diffuse out into the plasma and is converted to thiocyanate. Hence, monitoring plasma thiocyanate concentrations during prolonged (days) nitroprusside infusion is a useful marker of impending systemic cyanide toxicity. Poisoning may be obvious as a progressive metabolic acidosis, or may manifest as delirium or psychotic symptoms. Intoxicated subjects are also reputed to have the characteristic bitter almond smell of hydrogen cyanide. Clearly nitroprusside infusion must be used with caution, and outside specialist units it may be safer overall to choose another more familiar drug.Sodium nitroprusside is used in hypertensive emergencies, refractory heart failure and for controlled hypotension in surgery. An infusion17 may begin at 0.3–1.0 micrograms/kg/min, and control of blood pressure is likely to be established at 0.5–6.0 micrograms/kg/min; close monitoring of blood pressure is mandatory, usually by direct arterial monitoring; rate changes of infusion may be made every 5–10 min.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978070204084900063XAcute, chronic, recovery, and prevention stagesAnika Niambi Al-Shura BSc, MSOM, PhD, in Herbal, Bio-Nutrient and Drug Titration According to Disease Stages in Integrative Cardiovascular Chinese Medicine, 2020Screening testsSee Table 4.4.Tests that evaluate results of hypertensive emergencies:•Electrolytes•Blood urea nitrogen•Creatinine levels are used to identify renal impairment.•CBC and smear help exclude microangiopathic anemia.•Renal impairment: dipstick urinalysis can be used to detect hematuria or proteinuria; microscopic urinalysis can be used to detect RBCs or RBC casts.•Toxicology screen•Pregnancy test•Endocrine testsRadiologic studiesThese are generally ordered when there is suspicion of advanced renal damage, specifically renal artery stenosis:•Noninvasive: computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography•Invasive: renal angiographyEchocardiographyEvaluates for end-organ damage in a patient with borderline high blood pressure:•LVH despite normal or borderline-high BP measurements requires antihypertensive therapy.•Detects left atrial dilatation and left ventricular dysfunction (diastolic or systolic) more frequently than electrocardiography•Prognosis for hypertension with coronary artery disease (CAD)View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128175804000044Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011TreatmentHypertensive encephalopathy is regarded as a hypertensive emergency, which is defined as any situation that requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus.12Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour, with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 110 mm Hg.55 If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit, and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive drops in pressure must be avoided, particularly in the elderly patient and the patient with preexisting hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable.12,55Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria, as follows: are usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and are easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol, and sodium nitroprusside.12,55,56 There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity.57Nicardipine is a second-generation calcium channel antagonist. It is an arterial vasodilator with no negative inotropic activity. The onset of action of intravenous nicardipine is 5 to 15 minutes from administration, with a duration of action of 4 to 6 hours. Nicardipine has been demonstrated to increase coronary blood flow with favorable effect on myocardial oxygen balance. As a result of its rapid onset of action, its ease of use (dosage independent of body weight), and its demonstrated efficacy, nicardipine has become the first-line treatment for hypertensive emergencies.55,56Labetalol has both α-blocking and β-blocking activity, with a recognized value in the majority of hypertensive emergencies except for acute heart failure. The β-blocking effect of labetalol is about a fifth that of propranolol. The hypotensive effect of labetalol begins within 2 to 5 minutes, reaching a peak at 5 to 15 minutes after administration and lasting for about 2 to 4 hours. It has the advantage of maintaining cardiac output and cerebral and coronary blood flow, and it is associated with good clinical safety, provided that the usual contraindications to β-blockers are observed. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Bradycardia, heart block, bronchospasm, and heart failure can also complicate its use.12,55,56Urapidil is a peripheral A1 postsynaptic receptor antagonist as well as a central 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor agonist. Its vasodilatory action is not accompanied by reflex tachycardia or any significant modification of the renin-angiotensin system. Urapidil decreases both cardiac preload and afterload and also induces selective pulmonary and renal vasodilatation. It has a good safety profile; its single contraindication is aortic stenosis.55 Sodium nitroprusside is a short-acting arterial and venous dilatator that induces a simultaneous reduction in cardiac preload and afterload, making it useful in the treatment of hypertensive crises accompanied by heart failure. It should be given only by continuous intravenous infusion (0.25-2 μg/kg/min). However, several of the following factors limit its use. First, by increasing intracranial pressure, nitroprusside decreases the cerebral flow rate. Second, it is common for blood pressure to be unintentionally below a safe target level during treatment. Third, nitroprusside promotes baroreflex activation, causing tachycardia that can exacerbate acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. Other complications include cyanate or thiocyanate toxicity when the drug is given for a long period (days), especially in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Finally, nitroprusside infusion requires intra-arterial monitoring of blood pressure, which may not otherwise be required. It is now less widely used as first-line treatment because of its adverse effects and the availability of other drugs that are easier to use.12,55,56Other parenteral drugs used for hypertensive emergencies include fenoldopam, a selective postsynaptic dopamine-1 receptor agonist. Reported side effects of fenoldopam include headache, flushing, and increased intraocular pressure. Enalaprilat is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor available for intravenous administration. Its onset of action is delayed for 15 minutes, and it does not reach peak effect for about 1 hour. The relative slow onset limits its use in hypertensive encephalopathy. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used cautiously in patients who are hypovolemic or in those with underlying renal artery stenosis, because these drugs can lead to precipitous falls in blood pressure. Intravenous hydralazine is a commonly administered arteriolar vasodilator that is effective for hypertensive emergencies associated with pregnancies. The most common adverse effect of hydralazine administration is unpredictable hypotension.58 Phentolamine, clonidine, and diazoxide are no longer part of the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued.The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and removal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs.4 Delivery is the ultimate cure for eclampsia. If convulsions have occurred, parenteral magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice.59 The role of prophylactic magnesium sulfate in preeclampsia is less clear. There is also long-standing experience with several suitable antihypertensive drugs. The parenteral antihypertensive drugs most commonly used during pregnancy are labetalol, nicardipine, hydralazine, and urapidil.55,58,60 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists are contraindicated in pregnancy because of unacceptable fetal side effects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375A Worldwide Yearly Survey of New Data in Adverse Drug ReactionsKeaton S. Smetana PharmD, BCCCP, ... Casey C. May PharmD, BCCCP, in Side Effects of Drugs Annual, 2020PhenylephrineIntracranial hemorrhage (ICH) related to hypertensive emergency due to intracavernosal phenylephrine was reported in a 43-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease status post a combination kidney-pancreas transplant, and recurrent idiopathic priapism [21A]. The patient received two rounds (1 h apart) of a local injection of 100 μg phenylephrine into each corpus cavernosa with resolution of priapism. Within 5 min, the patient developed headaches, dyspnea and excruciating chest pain with a blood pressure of 240/130 mmHg which normalized spontaneously within a few minutes. During that time, he developed new-onset right arm and leg weakness and was found to have a midbrain ICH. The authors concluded that intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine is commonly used and well tolerated; however, close monitoring should occur after its administration.Inter-individual differences in response to phenylephrine infusions are frequently observed, and previous studies which had revealed a possible genetic component could not be replicated. To better understand if genetic variants contribute to variable sensitivity to phenylephrine infusions for the treatment of hypotension during anesthesia a retrospective analysis of electronic anesthetic records data coupled with the genetic data was performed [22H]. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilizing EHR data, three sub-groups were identified for phenylephrine responsiveness: (1) normal or high BP with low infusion rate (sensitive), (2) correction of severe hypotension by still low BP with low infusion rate (intermediate), and (3) ameliorated yet still low BP requiring high infusion rate (resistant). Through a meta-analysis of the phase I and phase II GWAS, a 3′UTR variant of EDN2 was identified as one of the top hits associated with the ability to significantly differentiate resistant from sensitive groups. EDN2 encodes endothelin-2, a secretory vasoconstrictive peptide that can cause potent long-lasting vasoconstriction by binding to endothelin type A (ETA) receptors on arterial smooth muscle cells. Despite EDN2’s robust biological relevance to vasoconstriction, the authors concluded further functional as well as replication studies are necessary to confirm this association with phenylephrine.Using phenylephrine and epinephrine during hypospadias repair in male rats demonstrated better postoperative structural outcomes and showed no adverse effects [23E]. Male rats were allocated into three groups: Group 1 (n = 5)—underwent surgery without using any agents, Group 2 (n = 5)—underwent surgery with diluted phenylephrine (1:5000) and Group 3 (n = 5)—underwent surgery with diluted epinephrine (1:100,000). When phenylephrine and epinephrine were utilized, they were injected in the urethral plate before operation and quantitative and qualitative histological evaluation of all penises was performed after 3 weeks. The results indicated the volumes of spongy tissue and collagen bundles and the number of fibroblasts were significantly higher (35%–55%) in Groups 2 and 3 in comparison to Group 1 (P < 0.05). This study found that in rats, hypospadias repair using phenylephrine and epinephrine lead to better postoperative serological outcomes compared to surgery alone; however, further experimental and human studies are needed to draw a firm conclusion on the effectiveness of inducing hemostasis without impairment of wound healing with using these agents during hypospadias surgery.Phenylephrine activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channels (TRPV1) may underlie trigeminal nociception leading to cranial pain such as local burning sensations or headaches caused by administration of high doses of phenylephrine [24E]. When phenylephrine is used at high concentrations as a mydriatic agent as for the treatment of nasal congestion, common adverse side-effects seen are transient burning sensations, indicating activation of the trigeminal nociceptive system. In a rat model, neuropeptide release, calcium imaging and meningeal blood flow recordings were applied to clarify possible receptor mechanisms underlying these pain phenomena. At high concentrations of phenylephrine, TRPV1 receptor channels of perivascular afferents were activated. This caused a calcium inflow releasing CGRP, which increases meningeal blood flow and overrides the α-adrenoceptor-induced constriction. The TRPV1 receptor agonism leads to long lasting depolarization of trigeminal neurons and likely leads to trigeminal pain and headaches. This may be the underlying mechanism for reported pain and reduced doses may be needed in individuals who have reported headaches.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037860802030009XSide effects of miscellaneous antibacterial drugsTalia Wall Pharm.D., Tyler D. Maxwell BS, Pharm.D., in Side Effects of Drugs Annual, 2021HematologicA 52 YOM patient presented to the ED in hypertensive emergency. He subsequently developed respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury and was ventilated during his hospitalization. As a complication of ventilation, he developed pneumonia. Vancomycin and meropenem were empirically initiated. On day 3 of therapy, his platelet count decreased to 3 × 109/L. After several platelet transfusions, his platelet count remained low, and as a result, he developed an intrapulmonary hemorrhage. Antibiotics were discontinued and corticosteroid treatment was initiated. After 7 days of corticosteroid therapy, his platelet counts returned to normal limits. The diagnosis of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia was confirmed through an antibody-platelet assay (Abdalhadi et al., 2020) [A].A 26 YOM was diagnosed with MRSA infective endocarditis and treated with an antibiotic regimen including vancomycin. After 1 week of treatment, the patient developed thrombocytopenia. He received 3 platelet transfusions separated by 1–2 weeks each. Following each infusion of platelets, the patient recorded a transient increase in platelet counts towards normal limits and a subsequent decrease after vancomycin administration. After 6 weeks of treatment, vancomycin was discontinued and daptomycin was initiated. The platelet count elevated to within normal limits. A Literature review indicates 37 vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia cases, the majority of which were resolved within 7 days after vancomycin discontinuation (Guleng et al., 2021) [A].View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378608021000416DiazoxideMelissa Stauffer, in xPharm: The Comprehensive Pharmacology Reference, 2007TherapeuticsDiazoxide is indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.IndicationsValueUnitsPrep. and Route of Admin.ReferenceCommentsHypertensive emergencyDosage50-150mgi.v.Hardman et al (2001)Administered at intervals of 5-15 min.Hypertensive emergencyDosage15-30mg/mini.v.Garrett and Kaplan (1982)Prior administration of a beta adrenoceptor antagonist enhances the hypotensive effect of diazoxide.HypoglycemiaDosage3-8; 8-15mg/kg/dayp.o.Hardman et al (2001)Adults; infantsContraindicationsDiazoxide is contraindicated in those with hypertension associated with coarctation, AV shunt, or aortic dissection, with acute pulmonary edema or with ischemic heart disease Hardman et al (2001).Adverse EffectsSide effects associated with the i.v. administration of diazoxide include myocardial ischemia, salt and water retention, and hyperglycemia Hardman et al (2001).

David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007EpilepsyBy analogy with hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy, it seems likely that trimethaphan may also be useful therapy during hypertensive emergencies caused by diencephalic epilepsy; however, for preventing hypertension during seizures that occur outside the hospital setting, phenoxybenzamine would be the most effective therapy if available.Here an explanation is in order for the need for a noncompetitive alpha receptor antagonist. Paroxysmal hypertension due to discharge of catecholamines from sympathetic nerve boutons is best treated with phenoxybenzamine because it is a noncompetitive antagonist. It binds covalently to alpha receptors, so that when a norepinephrine molecule arrives the receptor is already occupied (Figure 75-4). Because the paroxysm releases such a flood of catecholamines, it is not possible to treat this effectively with competitive alpha-blockers: in order to have enough antagonist on board to deal with the paroxysm when it happens, the blood pressure while standing would be so low between paroxysms that the patient would not be able to walk around. This principle applies equally to the management of pheochromocytoma and to that of disorders of reflex control of blood pressure in which severe hypertension results from paroxysmal sympathetic discharge.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of Thermal BiologyJournalToxicology Cases for the Clinical and Forensic LaboratoryBook • 2020Scientific AfricanJournalBiochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - BioenergeticsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Patel MD, James A. De Lemos MD, in Decision Making in Medicine (Third Edition), 2010Hypotension can result in multiorgan dysfunction if not treated immediately. As a result, diagnostic assessments and therapeutic maneuvers should occur rapidly and simultaneously.A.Initially, a rapid assessment should be made to identify patients who are critically ill and unresponsive or who are clinically unstable. For these patients, Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocols should be immediately initiated.B.Clinical examination, laboratory data, and noninvasive tests should be used to distinguish between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic causes of hypotension because the management of each one is markedly different. Careful attention to volume and perfusion status can help differentiate etiologies.C.Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization can help differentiate among different causes of hypotension. PA catheters should be used prudently because there is no indication from clinical trials that they provide clinical benefit when used routinely. (CO, cardiac output; PCWP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; SVR, systemic vascular resistance; PVR, pulmonary vascular resistance.)D.Cardiogenic shock most commonly results from large myocardial infarctions (MIs; >40% of left ventricle) leading to pump failure. Mechanical complications of MI, including right ventricular dysfunction, acute mitral regurgitation, septal rupture, and free-wall rupture, can also lead to cardiogenic shock. In patients with mechanical complications, urgent surgical repair is needed. Other cardiac causes of cardiogenic hypotension include pericardial tamponade, severe obstructive valvular heart disease, and progression of a chronic cardiomyopathy. Urgent echocardiography is particularly helpful in delineating the causes of cardiogenic shock.E.In cardiogenic shock from acute MI, urgent coronary revascularization is indicated, often with support of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). For initial stabilization and for treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock, inotropic support may be initiated with dobutamine or dopamine (dobutamine is generally preferred because dopamine has significant chronotropic and vasoconstrictive properties that may worsen cardiac ischemia). If hypotension still persists, other drugs such as milrinone or norepinephrine may be tried.F.Causes of vasodilatory hypotension include sepsis, adrenal crisis, drug effects, anaphylaxis, and neurogenic shock and require treatment of the underlying pathologic process and supportive treatment with volume resuscitation and IV vasopressors. Notably, volume resuscitation is the first-line supportive treatment for sepsis because sepsis is associated with hypovolemic hypotension. However, sepsis can also be associated with a cardiomyopathy, and this may limit the amount of volume resuscitation that can be administered.G.Obstructive hypotension is most commonly caused by massive pulmonary thromboembolism. Treatment options include thrombolytic therapy or surgical embolectomy. Supportive measures involving volume resuscitation, vasopressors, and inotropes should be used cautiously because they may augment right ventricular strain.H.The management of hypovolemic hypotension should involve volume resuscitation and treatment of the cause of intravascular volume loss (e.g., bleeding, diarrhea, third-space sequestration). Crystalloids, colloid-containing solutions, or blood products can be used for volume resuscitation; however, there is no clinical benefit to using colloid-containing solutions over crystalloids.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323041072500296The Neonate With Relative Adrenal Insufficiency and Vasopressor ResistanceErika F Fernandez, in Hemodynamics and Cardiology (Third Edition), 2019AbstractHypotension in the neonate is defined by low blood pressure associated with decreased systemic and organ blood flow. In a proportion of critically ill neonates, especially preterm neonates, hypotension is associated with adrenal insufficiency. Accordingly, corticosteroids have been increasingly used in the treatment of systemic hypotension in this patient population. Although recent information has led to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies of neonatal hypotension associated with adrenal insufficiency, more data are needed to understand the benefits and risks of the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency and the associated hypotension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323533669000302Noncardiac Surgery in the Patient with Cardiovascular Disease: Preoperative Evaluation and Perioperative CareHOWARD H. WEITZ MD, in Medical Management of the Surgical Patient (Third Edition), 2008PERIOPERATIVE HYPOTENSIONPerioperative hypotension may result in myocardial ischemia and is a predictor of postoperative cardiac morbidity. A perioperative decrease of mean arterial blood pressure of more than 20 mm Hg has been shown to increase postoperative cardiac complications. The most common causes of perioperative hypotension are intravascular volume depletion and excessive vasodilation. Hypotension may be induced by anesthetic agents. Spinal anesthesia may result in hypotension related to vasodilation. Several of the inhalational anesthetic agents (e.g., isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane) may cause hypotension by peripheral vasodilation as well as by myocardial depression. Other causes of perioperative hypotension include MI, pulmonary embolus, and sepsis. Hypotension caused by volume depletion or vasodilation is best treated by volume expansion. When clinically significant vasodilation-induced hypotension does not respond to this approach, a peripheral vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine) should be considered. Hypotension resulting from direct myocardial depression may be treated with inotropic agents such as dopamine, dobutamine, and milrinone.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416023852500081Vital SignsBrian K. Peterson, in Physical Rehabilitation, 2007HYPOTENSIONHypotension is generally defined as a systolic BP of 90 mm Hg or lower, although in some adults such a low BP may be normal.1 Signs and symptoms of clinically significant hypotension include tachycardia, dizziness, mental confusion, restlessness, cool, clammy, pale or cyanotic skin, and syncope.29 Low BP in conjunction with symptoms of shock or circulatory collapse indicates a dangerous condition that can rapidly progress to death unless treated.2 Shock may be caused by a reduction in BP as a result of a wide range of causes, including hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, myocardial infarction, and overwhelming infection. Signs and symptoms of shock include hypotension, tachycardia, cold clammy skin, dizziness, blurred vision, and apprehension. The presence of low BP and any of these symptoms may indicate onset of shock or circulatory collapse and should be taken seriously, including ensuring immediate medical attention.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780721603612500259High-Risk Percutaneous Coronary InterventionsMichael J. Lim, ... William M. Suh, in Interventional Cardiac Catheterization Handbook (Third Edition), 2013HypotensionHypotension may result from myocardial ischemia, coronary perforation with cardiac tamponade, arrhythmia, contrast- or medication-induced anaphylaxis, or acute occult bleeding (e.g., retroperitoneal hematoma). This differential diagnosis of hypotension must be evaluated quickly and therapy directed to the cause of the hypotension. After the first step of aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline, support blood pressure with inotropic agents such as dopamine (initial starting infusion rate of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min depending on degree of hypotension) or bolus dose norepinephrine (2.5–5 mcg IV boluses as needed). An emergent echocardiogram will help assess for cardiac tamponade or valvular dysfunction. The treatment of anaphylaxis is discussed below (Table 12-10).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323080576000124Transitional Hemodynamics and Pathophysiology of Peri/Intraventricular HemorrhageShahab Noori, ...

These include postnatal maladaptation superimposed on immaturity of the cardiovascular system, inadequate compensation for a PDA shunt, prevalence of relative adrenal insufficiency, increased rate of sepsis, acidosis, and the detrimental impact of inappropriate ventilator support on neonatal hemodynamics. Hypotension has long been recognized as a risk factor for P/IVH.57,58 Given the fact that hypotension is a hallmark of uncompensated shock, the association between hypotension and P/IVH is not surprising. However, the uncertainty about the definition of hypotension and the influence of other coexisting variables (see Chapter 3) make it difficult to propose a “safe” blood pressure range.Over the past decade, there has been an increasing concern about the possible role of treatment of hypotension in the occurrence of P/IVH and poor neurodevelopmental outcome associated with hypotension.59-61 This is indeed a possibility, at least theoretically. By definition, hypotensive preterm infants are outside the CBF autoregulatory range where cerebral perfusion is pressure passive.62,63 Therefore, inappropriate titration of vasopressor-inotropes can increase blood pressure and brain blood flow62,64 and thus, in theory, increase the risk of P/IVH (see Chapter 3). However, of note is that although careful, stepwise titration of vasopressor-inotropes for hypotension restores brain blood flow along with the blood pressure, CBF autoregulation does not regain its functionality for a period of time.62,64 Yet there are data, although not conclusive, on the potential beneficial effects of careful titration of cardiovascular medications.58,65,66 It is likely that the underlying pathophysiology of brain injury associated with hypotension is multifactorial and that low CBF due to low perfusion pressure, inappropriate treatment, and titration of vasopressor-inotropes resulting in intermittent cerebral hypo- and hyperperfusion and other coexisting factors independent of hypotension all contribute in varying degrees to the development of P/IVH. The fact that hypotension is almost always treated,67 albeit at different thresholds, makes establishing causality for adverse outcomes and defining the extent of contribution of various aspects of clinical care to the development of P/IVH in response to hypotension nearly impossible. There are many challenges in designing a study to ascertain the impact of each of these factors in the pathogenesis of P/IVH and poor neurodevelopmental outcome. These include the inability to utilize a physiology-based and individualized definition of hypotension for each patient, the heterogeneous etiology and pathophysiology of hypotension (i.e., abnormality in preload, contractility, afterload and/or vascular tone dysregulation), and the complexity of selecting the appropriate treatment for the given pathophysiology and clinical presentation. In addition, given the strong belief among neonatologists of the harmful effect of hypotension, conducting randomized control trials with a no treatment arm appears not feasible.67 However, several ongoing trials are investigating the effect of hypotension on outcome by using different thresholds for treatment or by incorporating advanced monitoring technology to enhance the identification of the threshold of hypotension (see Chapter 3).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323533669000065Prehospital and Emergency Department Care of the Patient with Acute StrokeOpeolu Adeoye, Arthur Pancioli, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011HypotensionHypotension can decrease cerebral perfusion pressure and subsequently lead to a significant extension of an area of cerebral infarction. During an acute stroke, perfusion of ischemic areas is directly related to the mean arterial pressure. Hypotension should be evaluated and aggressively treated. As an initial intervention, putting the patient’s head down flat can increase blood pressure and cerebral perfusion and can sometimes result in clinical improvement. In addition, hypotension can be treated with IV fluids, inotropic agents, or vasopressors as necessary to maintain perfusion and prevent extension of an infarct. Physicians must search for a cause for a patient’s relative hypotension. The emergency physician must be constantly vigilant for other diseases, such as AMI, gastrointestinal bleeding, occult trauma, aortic dissection, and sepsis.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141605478810048XEmergency Airway ManagementNazish K. Hashmi, ... Raquel R. Bartz, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Third Edition), 2019Hypotension.Hypotension in the postintubation setting is due to the combination of a myriad of hemodynamic alterations. The vasodilatory and occasional myocardial depressant effects of induction agents—as well as attenuation of the sympathetic response from hypoxia and hypercarbia—may contribute to hypotension. In patients with hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, and underlying myocardial depression, especially RV dysfunction, the initiation of positive pressure ventilation and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) will also contribute to postintubation hypotension.52 Positive pressure ventilation will decrease venous return to the right heart, which will lower the preload. It also increases RV afterload, resulting in reduced LV filling pressures and hence, decreased stroke volume. Postintubation hypotension is associated with poor outcomes and prolonged hospital length of stay, especially in traumatized and neurologically injured patients.53View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323529938000497Heart and circulatory system drugs and diureticsCorinna Weber-Schöndorfer, in Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation (Second Edition), 20072.8.15 Hypotension and antihypotensivesHypotension (low blood pressure) may occur in some healthy people with a normal heart and blood vessels. Symptoms usually occur only when the blood pressure is so low that blood flow to the brain is reduced, causing dizziness and fainting. The most common type of hypotension is postural hypotension, where symptoms occur after abruptly standing or sitting. Postural hypotension is sometimes an adverse effect of drug treatment (antidepressants), or may be due to illness (diabetes mellitus), or to nerve damage that disrupts the reflexes controlling blood pressure. In the majority of cases, treatment of hypotension depends on the underlying cause.In the 1980s, particular attention was paid to the consequences of chronic hypotension in pregnancy. An increased rate of prematurity of up to 17 percent was attributed to untreated hypotension (Goeschen 1984), and treatment during pregnancy was advocated. Dihydroergotamine was considered to be more effective than the adrenergic substances, and use of this drug in hypotensive pregnant women has been reported in the German literature (Goeschen 1984). However, its use in pregnancy is controversial because of its potential oxytocic effects and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with vascular injury (Raymond 1995).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444520722500124Prehospital and Emergency Department Care of the Patient With Acute StrokeCharles E Kircher, Opeolu Adeoye, in Stroke (Seventh Edition), 2022HypotensionAcute hypotension can be detrimental to ischemic stroke patients, as CPP is directly linked to mean arterial pressure via the following equation:CPP=MAP−ICPIn patients with normal ICP (8–12 mm Hg), effort should be made to maintain a MAP of 65–70 or greater to allow for adequate CPP. Some patients will have stroke symptoms triggered by hypotension or “pressure-dependent” exams or lesions where maintaining a higher (or normal) MAP/SBP target results in clinical improvement. These patients may experience fluctuation of symptoms even when the BP is within a “normal” range and may benefit from higher MAP targets. However, induced hypertension for patients with AIS is of uncertain benefit.1Regardless of the goal SBP or MAP, fluid resuscitation and flat positioning are the first maneuvers to attempt for acute hypotension. Emergency clinicians must keep a broad differential diagnosis for hypotension and shock even in the face of acute stroke symptoms. Arterial dissections, hypovolemic shock, and sepsis can all produce stroke mimics in association with hypotension, or directly contribute to formation of embolic strokes. If hypotension does not respond to fluids, vasopressors and/or blood products are necessary to restore optimal organ and CPPs. Bedside echocardiography can be useful to evaluate patients with persistent hypotension and, when performed by a skilled operator, can narrow the differential diagnosis in these complex patients.75–77View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323694247000521Recommended publicationsInfo iconHealth & PlaceJournalChestJournalDental AbstractsJournalInternational Journal of Law and PsychiatryJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

      "ScienceDirectJournals & BooksSearchRegisterSign inOrthostatic HypotensionOrthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10mmHg from a sitting to a standing position.From: Heart and Toxins, 2015Related terms:Combination TherapyPatientInpatientFaintnessBlood PressureDizzinessDrug TherapyView all TopicsAdd to MendeleySet alertAbout this pageOrthostatic HypotensionItalo Biaggioni, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease (Third Edition), 2018Evaluation of the Patient with Orthostatic HypotensionOH is defined as a sustained reduction of SBP of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 10 mm Hg within 3 min of standing, or head-up tilt to at least 60 degrees.14 In hypertensive patients, a reduction in SBP of 30 mm Hg is considered a more appropriate criterion for orthostatic hypotension because the magnitude of the orthostatic blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.14 Typical symptoms of OH are lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, dimming of vision, and shoulder (“coat hanger”) pain. Patients may be asymptomatic or may have difficulty identifying their symptoms. It is useful to consider that, as a general rule, symptoms should never start while the patient is supine, should occur mostly while standing, and should be quickly relived by seating or lying down. Symptoms tend to be worse in hot environments and if patients stand still. The severity of OH is also greater in the morning, so much so that the diagnosis of OH is more likely to be made if orthostatic vitals are taken in the morning than in the afternoon.15The evaluation and diagnosis of OH can be done at the bedside. Autonomic testing, often restricted to specialized units, is helpful to assess the presence and severity of autonomic impairment (neurogenic OH). It is, however, not essential. Measuring orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate is often all that is needed. A significant decrease in orthostatic blood pressure that is not associated with an appropriate increase in heart rate is indicative of neurogenic OH. Another practical alternative to specialized testing is to clinically try to improve OH by removing factors that can trigger or aggravate OH (see below under management); any significant OH that remains is likely to have an important neurogenic component.The list of etiologies that cause neurogenic OH is long but most become apparent after a comprehensive evaluation. In principle, any disease that causes peripheral neuropathy can cause autonomic neuropathy and neurogenic OH. In practice, diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common culprit. Tight glucose control can delay the progression of autonomic neuropathy in type 1 diabetes,16 but the evidence for type 2 diabetes is less clear. B12 deficiency should be ruled out because its treatment can lead to improvement of OH.17 Special attention should be given to patients that develop severe OH with a subacute onset and rapid progression, for they often have an autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndrome; in some cases neurogenic OH can be the presenting problem which leads to the diagnosis of the underlying disease.18View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323429733000421Orthostatic HypotensionLaura Barritt, in xPharm: The Comprehensive Pharmacology Reference, 2007EtiologyOrthostatic hypotension may result from non-neurogenic causes such as cardiac impairment, hypovolemia, and venous pooling. Neurogenic causes of this condition are associated with central or peripheral autonomic disorders. Non-neurogenic Causes Acute onset non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is one of the most common forms of the condition. It is frequently caused by a decrease in intravascular blood volume due to, vomiting, dehydration or hemorrhage. Acute orthostatic hypotension may also accompany myocardial infarcts. Chronic forms of non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are usually associated with disorders causing cardiac impairment, anemia, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus, or vascular insufficiencies such as varicose veins Hermosillo et al (2001). Numerous drugs cause orthostatic hypotension by impairing autonomic reflex mechanisms or by inducing excessive diuresis and vasodilation. Included are loop diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, nitrate preparations, antihypertensives, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, phenothiazine antipsychotics, barbiturates, levodopa, quinidine, and alcoholMathias and Kimber (1999). Neurogenic Causes Acute causes of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, such as primary idiopathic pandysautonomia, are rare and reflect a breakdown of autonomic regulatory mechanisms. Both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are usually affected in this condition. Chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is often attributed to neurodegenerative diseases that interrupt the sympathetic reflex arc and impair the normal adrenergic responses to standing. Primary causes of chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension include pure autonomic failure, such as that associated with Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome or idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, and multiple system atrophy, a characteristic of Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, or striatonigral degeneration Mathias (1996). In both cases, orthostatic hypotension is a central feature caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction associated with low levels of norepinephrine. Secondary causes of chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are usually associated with diseases or syndromes that are inherited or acquired. Secondary forms of autonomic failure due to systemic disease are a more common cause of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Other conditions with impaired autonomic function include diabetes mellitus, Guillain-Barre syndrome, tabes dorsalis, syringomyelia, and amyloidosisMathias and Kimber (1999).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080552323606749ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSIONHoracio Kaufmann, Italo Biaggioni, in Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience, 2007DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION OF ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSIONOrthostatic hypotension produces a characteristic clinical history. Symptoms of lightheadedness and tunnel vision occur on standing, never while the person is lying down, and are always relieved immediately on sitting or lying down, because cerebral blood flow is passively restored. Failure to meet these criteria suggests other causes of impaired consciousness (e.g., hypoglycemia, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias).16 In patients with diabetes or other peripheral neuropathies, proprioceptive abnormalities lead to feeling of unsteadiness that patients refer as dizziness, which may wrongly suggest orthostatic hypotension. In addition to the classic lightheadedness with blurred vision and syncope, symptoms of chronic orthostatic hypotension may include vague generalized weakness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain in the shoulders and back of the neck (coat hanger pain).Many patients with chronic autonomic failure can tolerate very low orthostatic blood pressures with few symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, perhaps because their cerebral autoregulatory capacity is well preserved.17 However, physical exercise, prolonged standing, the postprandial state, or mild volume depletion exacerbates orthostatic hypotension and invariably triggers symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, including presyncope or syncope.The diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension relies on simple measurements of blood pressure and heart rate after the patient has lain down for 5 to 10 minutes and after 1 to 3 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension is arbitrarily defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg and in diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing, in association with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion.18 On occasion, the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension may require repeated measurements of blood pressure throughout the day. In patients with autonomic impairment, the severity of orthostatic hypotension is worse early in the morning or about 30 minutes after a meal compared to the rest of the day.Concomitant measurements of heart rate are crucial for adequate interpretation of results. Side effects of medications are arguably the most common causes of orthostatic hypotension. The most common culprits are tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, nitrates, and α blockers used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy. In these cases, there is usually a compensatory increase in heart rate in association with orthostatic hypotension. In contrast, the presence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension without an adequate compensatory increase in heart rate is sufficient clinical indication of autonomic failure (Fig. 28-3). The diagnosis can be easily confirmed with simple measurements of heart rate and blood pressure (Table 28-1). No single test completely differentiates patients with autonomic failure from age-matched control subjects, but together these tests provide a reliable indicator of the presence and severity of cardiovascular autonomic impairment.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323033541500328Postural HypotensionMichael J. Aminoff, in Neurology and General Medicine (Fourth Edition), 2008Alterations of Effective Blood VolumePostural hypotension can occur because of loss of effective blood volume. Normal adults can withstand the loss of 500 ml of blood or bodily fluids with few if any symptoms, but greater volume depletion may occur acutely for a variety of reasons (e.g., hemorrhage or burns) and cause a postural drop in blood pressure. Hyponatremia and Addison's disease may also lead to an absolute reduction in blood volume. Postural hypotension may occur owing to venous pooling in patients with severe varicose veins or congenital absence of venous valves or because of poor peripheral resistance and reduced muscle tone in patients with paralyzed limbs. Similarly, it may occur during the late stages of pregnancy owing to obstructed venous return by the gravid uterus. Marked vasodilatation, such as occurs in the heat or with the use of certain drugs or alcohol, sometimes causes postural hypotension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443067075500110Orthostatic HypotensionI. Biaggioni, H. Kaufmann, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences (Second Edition), 2014DefinitionOrthostatic hypotension is arbitrarily defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 min of standing. It is best characterized clinically as any decrease in arterial blood pressure that produces symptoms such as lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain in the back of the neck. If the fall in blood pressure is pronounced, cerebral blood flow is compromised and transient loss of consciousness (i.e., syncope) may occur. Symptoms never occur while supine but usually occur shortly after standing and are always relieved immediately on sitting or lying down. Failure to meet these criteria should make the physician rule out other causes of transient loss of consciousness (e.g., hypoglycemia, arrhythmias, or transient ischemic attacks). If patients have symptoms suggestive of, but do not have documented, orthostatic hypotension, repeated measurements of blood pressure should be performed. Occasionally, patients may have delayed orthostatic hypotension, which is only apparent after they stand for 10–30 min.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123851574005078Postural HypotensionWilliam A.

Sodeman M.D., in Instructions for Geriatric Patients (Third Edition), 2005General InformationPostural hypotension, which physicians also call orthostatic hypotension, is a fall in the blood pressure that occurs when one goes from a lying to a standing position. This fall in blood pressure when rising can cause weakness, light-headedness, dizziness, or syncope (fainting). It is a problem that emerges with increasing frequency with advancing age.There are multiple causes. Vascular and nervous system changes with age can, alone, produce this reaction in the blood pressure. Diseases that affect the cardiovascular system and the nervous system can do so as well. A number of endocrine diseases can also be involved. Many drugs may produce this response as an effect or a side effect.Your doctor will undertake a comprehensive review of your medical history and physical examination to look for possible causes. A number of laboratory and other tests may be required to identify or eliminate possible causes.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416002031501049Autonomic DysfunctionL. Norcliffe-Kaufmann, H. Kaufmann, in Encyclopedia of Movement Disorders, 2010Cardiovascular abnormalitiesOrthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a fall of at least 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic BP accompanied by symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion within 3 min of standing. In the autonomic synucleinopathies, OH is typically caused by impaired sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction in the systemic circulation, a reflex response that normally compensates for the gravitational fluid shifts to the lower body when in the upright position (Figure 1). Around 40% of patients with PD have OH. In patients with PD who have OH, beat-to-beat recordings of BP and heart rate during prolonged upright tilt reveal a progressive decline in BP with a smaller than normal increase in heart rate (Figure 2). If cerebral perfusion is significantly reduced syncope occurs. BP recordings during the Valsalva maneuver are also characteristically abnormal. The normal overshoot in BP after release of the strain (i.e., phase IV) is absent (Figure 3). This characteristic profile distinguishes OH due to autonomic failure from OH due to other causes, such as dehydration.Sign in to download full-size imageFigure 1. A schematic diagram of the baroreceptor reflex. The baroreflex is a negative feedback loop that regulates arterial BP. Arterial baroreceptors are located in the walls of the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and coronary vasculature and relay sensory information to the CNS through the glossopharyngeal (IXth) and vagus (Xth) nerves. These afferent neurons have their cell bodies in the petrosal (IXth) and nodose ganglia (X). The first synapse of the baroreflex is in the medulla, at the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), where baroreceptive information is integrated with inputs from other cardiovascular brain centers including the area postrema. Excitatory inputs project from the NTS to neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVL). In turn the CVL provides an inhibitory influence to the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVL), which contains pacemaker neurons that generate sympathetic tone. RVL neurons project caudally through the spinal cord to synapse with preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the IML column. Axons from preganglionic sympathetic neurons leave the spinal cord to synapse in peripheral ganglia with postganglionic sympathetic neurons, which release norepinephrine at target organs. This results in arteriolar vasoconstriction, venoconstriction, tachycardia, and an increase in cardiac contractility. Parasympathetic tone is also modulated by the baroreflex. Projections from the NTS to the nucleus ambiguus (NA) excite preganglionic cardiac parasympathetic nerves. In addition, neurons in the NTS project rostrally to the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus and control vasopressin (AVP) release. An increase in systemic BP stretches arterial baroreceptors and increases the firing rate of afferent fibers. This activates NTS and CVL neurons, which in turn inhibits RVL neurons and ‘withdraws’ sympathetic outflow. Activation of the NTS also results is activation of the NA and an increase in parasympathetic outflow together with inhibition of vasopressin secretion. The end result is systemic vasodilatation, bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac contractility, which restores BP back to ‘baseline’ levels. In general, sympathetic withdrawal is accompanied by parasympathetic activation and vice versa. Sympathetic activation to different organs is not homogenously distributed and depends on the stimuli and afferent pathways involved. For example, mental stress induces sympathetic activation and increases BP, but causes vasodilatation in the forearm vasculature.Sign in to download full-size imageFigure 2. Beat-to-beat BP and electrocardiographic RR intervals during passive head-up tilt in a patient with autonomic failure. Note hypertension when supine and a precipitous fall in BP upon head up tilt.

Beat-to-beat BP and electrocardiographic RR intervals during a Valsalva maneuver in a patient with autonomic failure and a healthy control. Note the absence of BP ‘overshoot’ after release of the strain in the patient with autonomic failure.OH in PD is related to the duration and severity of the disease and is often worsened by treatment with levodopa and dopaminergic agonists. However, neither of these drugs is the primary cause of OH in PD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741059000149SyncopeRose Anne Kenny, in Brocklehurst's Textbook of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology (Seventh Edition), 2010PathophysiologyOrthostatic or postural hypotension is arbitrarily defined as either a 20 mm Hg fall in systolic blood pressure or a 10 mm Hg fall in diastolic blood pressure on assuming an upright posture from a supine position. Orthostatic hypotension implies abnormal blood pressure homeostasis and is a frequent observation with advancing age. Prevalence of postural hypotension varies between 4% and 33% among community living older persons depending on the methodology used. Higher prevalence and larger falls in systolic blood pressure have been reported with increasing age and often signify general physical frailty. Orthostatic hypotension is an important cause of syncope, accounting for 14% of all diagnosed cases in a large series. In a tertiary referral clinic dealing with unexplained syncope, dizziness, and falls, 32% of patients over age 65 years had orthostatic hypotension as a possible attributable cause of symptoms.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416062318100467Orthostatic Hypotension☆L.C. Barritt, in Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences, 2014ClassificationOrthostatic hypotension is functionally classified as non-neurogenic or neurogenic based on symptoms and etiology. Both non-neurogenic and neurogenic causes may be further classified as acute or chronic based on the onset of the condition. Neurogenic disorders that produce orthostatic hypotension are further subdivided into primary and secondary causes (Consensus Committee of the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, 1996). Primary neurogenic causes of orthostatic hypotension, which are usually idiopathic, are disturbances affecting either the central or peripheral autonomic nervous system. Secondary causes are associated with systemic disorders that may impair autonomic regulation of blood pressure (Mathias and Kimber, 1999).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012801238305193XThe Neurology of AgingRichard K. Olney, Michael J. Aminoff, in Neurology and General Medicine (Fourth Edition), 2008Orthostatic HypotensionOrthostatic hypotension is present in 10 to 30 percent of subjects older than 65 years if defined as a decline of more than 20 mmHg in systolic pressure or of more than 10 mmHg in diastolic pressure for more than 1 minute. The presence of orthostatic hypotension is a risk factor for increased mortality over 4 years that is independent of other associated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and coronary artery disease.106 Orthostatic hypotension most commonly has a non-neurogenic cause; medication such as antihypertensives and tricyclic antidepressants are often responsible. A significant factor underlying the increasing frequency of orthostatic hypotension with age may be diminution in baroreceptor sensitivity with advancing age.107 The elderly have not only less reduction in heart rate in response to pressor drugs107 but also a blunted increase in heart rate with standing even in the absence of hypotension. In addition to blunting of the autonomic response as a predisposing factor to orthostatic hypotension, compensatory mechanisms that restrict volume depletion are also impaired in the elderly.Syncope becomes more common with advancing age, and orthostatic hypotension is a common cause.108 However, this diagnosis is accepted only when postural changes in blood pressure can be demonstrated by examination. Management of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension is initially with nonpharmacological methods; patients are encouraged to make slow position changes, to increase their fluid and salt intake, to use compression garments, and to elevate the head of the bed. Pharmacological treatment is typically with fludrocortisone or midodrine. Further discussion of autonomic function in the elderly is provided in Chapter 8.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443067075500602Recommended publicationsInfo iconThe American Journal of MedicineJournalGeriatric NursingJournalNursing Clinics of North AmericaJournalThe Journal for Nurse PractitionersJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

      "ScienceDirectJournals & BooksSearchRegisterSign inHypertensive Heart DiseaseHHD can be defined as the cardiomyopathy that results from the response of the heart to the stress imposed on the left ventricle by the progressively increasing arterial pressure.From: Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Related terms:AngiotensinAldosteroneMyocardial InfarctionVentricle of HeartEpicardial Coronary ArteriesLeft VentricleTissuesKidneysBlood PressureView all TopicsAdd to MendeleySet alertAbout this pageHeart FailureS.M. Hamza, ... J.R.B. Dyck, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Disease development and clinical presentationHHD is characterized by an abnormal thickening of the muscular wall of the LV, which is termed ‘left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),’ and generally occurs in the absence of any other causes except high arterial pressure in the case of HHD. This general hypertrophy is also accompanied by complex changes in the cellular composition of the heart muscle – these cellular changes are largely responsible for the structural remodeling that occurs in the heart. This remodeling is not only due to mechanical stress on the heart as it works harder against increasing blood pressure but also involves nerve signaling, hormones, and other biological mediators such as cytokines. In addition, these changes occur in both the heart cells themselves and the surrounding portions of the heart tissue. The essential criterion, which defines HHD, is the presence of LVH in the absence of a cause other than arterial hypertension. LV cavity dimension is typically normal, but LV mass is usually increased due to increased wall thickness (termed ‘concentric hypertrophy’). Despite this common presentation, ‘eccentric hypertrophy’ is also noted in HHD patients in whom the LV cavity size is larger than normal and wall thickness is much thinner. Although LVH is a key feature of HHD, it is also important to note that in the very early stages of HHD, it is now recognized that some impairment in ventricle relaxation, or diastolic dysfunction, is present even before there is any sign of development of LVH (Figure 3). In this early stage, systolic function is still preserved, and only diastolic dysfunction is evident. This distinction of the early phase of HHD is especially critical when considering early detection and treatment of heart dysfunction in this patient group, as will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.Figure 3. Schematic representation of the development of hypertensive-heart disease (HHD). LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.LVH is due to growth of heart cells and changes in the surrounding tissue or ‘ECM.’ These changes allow the heart to adapt to the increased workload and attempt to normalize wall stress during the contraction phase of the heart cycle, or ‘systole.’ Over time, however, the degree of heart cell growth in response to this mechanical stress becomes out of proportion such that the increase in LV mass is much higher compared to the underlying circulatory, or hemodynamic, stimulus. This exaggerated response of the heart cells may be due to genetic influences (i.e., variations of the ACE gene) and environmental factors such as obesity, increased salt intake, and diabetes, as will be discussed.In general, HHD represents a ‘true’ hypertrophic response, as there is typically an increase in heart cell size with no increase in cell number. This hypertrophic response can be divided into several different categories: (1) increased transverse or longitudinal size of the cell; (2) enhanced protein synthesis, leading to new sarcomere formation and cell thickening/elongation; (3) altered gene expression; and (4) ultrastructural changes involving the cell machinery (i.e., nuclei and mitochondria).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567033049Cardiovascular BiomarkersA. Rogier van der Velde, ... Rudolf A. de Boer, in Principles of Translational Science in Medicine (Second Edition), 2015Hypertensive Heart DiseaseHypertensive heart disease is characterized by persistent pressure overload, concentric hypertrophy, with a normal ejection fraction and normal or decreased end-diastolic volume (Levy et al., 1990). These patients are more often female, are older, have a higher BMI, and more often have diabetes. With persistent, prolonged hypertension, this form of compensated hypertrophy makes the transition to heart failure with an increase in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, decreased LVEF, increased LV chamber stiffness, and impaired LV relaxation (Frohlich et al., 1992). Hypertensive heart disease can induce heart failure without a significant decrease in LVEF, and diastolic dysfunction is an important contributor in decompensated heart failure.Animal models of hypertensive heart disease include a canine nephrectomy model (Morioka and Simon, 1982), and other variants of this model are also currently used (Shapiro et al., 2008). Models using smaller animals include the SHR (Pfeffer et al., 1982), the TGR(mREN2)27 rat (Pinto et al., 2000), aortic banding (Litwin et al., 1995), or genetically modified mice (Molkentin et al., 1998).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128006870000189The Eye in HypertensionTien Yin Wong, Paul Mitchell, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Relationship with other systemic diseases and risk factorsIn addition to stroke and heart disease, hypertensive retinopathy signs have been linked with a variety of systemic conditions and vascular risk factors. Hypertensive retinopathy signs have not been consistently associated with direct measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. In the ARIC study, while controlling for blood pressure generalized arteriolar narrowing was associated with carotid artery plaque but not intima-media thickeness, AV nicking was associated with carotid artery intima-media thickness but not carotid artery plaque, and focal arteriolar narrowing was not related to either carotid artery measure.12 In both the Rotterdam Eye Study and Cardiovascular Health Study, hypertensive retinopathy signs were not related to carotid artery disease.16,18Similarly, most studies have not been able to demonstrate clear associations of hypertensive retinopathy with traditional atherosclerosis risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, or obesity.19,42,43 There are several recent studies investigating associations with novel risk markers, such as biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen),12,16,19 endothelial cell activation (von-Willebrand factor),12 and angiogenesis (vascular growth endothelial factor,44 adiponectin,45 and leptin46). The significance of these associations remains to be determined.Renal impairment is another marker of target organ damage in individuals with hypertension. The presence of microalbuminuria and renal impairment is often associated with concomitant hypertensive retinopathy.47,48 In the ARIC study, individuals who developed renal dysfunction were more likely to have moderate retinopathy as compared to those without renal dsyfunction.49 This association was independent of the shared risk factors and was seen in persons without diabetes or hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500544Cardiac FibrosisHasse Brønnum, Raghu Kalluri, in Muscle, 2012Pressure and Volume OverloadCardiac diseases manifesting in pressure overload include hypertensive heart disease and aortic valve stenosis. Pressure overload mediates hypertrophy through thickening of the left ventricular wall with little or no increase in chamber size, whereas volume overload (valvular regurgitation) results in regular wall thickness but increased chamber size (140).Cardiac fibrosis in hypertensive disease is mediated through a combination of hemodynamics (pressure overload), and cascades of inflammatory and remodeling cascades. The latter is likely to involve classic pro-fibrotic mediators, such as AngII and TGF-β. However, while the inflammation phase of myocardial infarction is highly controlled by innate mechanisms, such as the complement system and toll-like receptor signaling, adaptive immunity is a major player in hypertension (141). Hence, T cell-mediated responses, along with cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17, are major drivers of hypertension and reparative fibrosis (see above).The degree of fibrosis may vary in hypertensive heart disease. In mild conditions, the structure of the ECM is preserved despite increased collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Severe cases are characterized by extensive cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cell death, along with increased and disorganized ECM and even sections of replacement fibrosis (142).Experimentally, cardiac fibrosis caused by hypertension has been widely investigated in rodent models through thoracic banding (Figure 29.1a) or chemically induced by, e.g., AngII or aldosterone infusion (143).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123815101000296Atherosclerotic Cerebral Infarction in Young AdultsJosé Biller, Rima M. Dafer, in Stroke in Children and Young Adults (Second Edition), 2009PathogenesisAtherosclerosis affects millions of adults. Ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower limbs constitute major public health problems. Coronary and cerebral atherosclerotic vascular diseases are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. Atherosclerosis, although uncommon before 40 years of age, has its onset in infancy and childhood.1–4 Atherosclerosis tends to affect the large and medium-sized arteries, such as the aorta, and iliac, superficial femoral, coronary, and cerebral arteries. Autopsy studies of men in their 20s killed during wartime indicated that more than two thirds had moderately advanced coronary atherosclerosis.The earliest morphologic arterial change in atherosclerosis is the juvenile (flat) fatty streak, commonly seen in children and adolescents. Raised fatty streaks (fatty plaque) represent the lesion intermediate between the juvenile (flat) fatty streak and the raised lesion of atherosclerosis. Many fatty streaks do not progress to fibrous plaques or complicated (ulcerative, thrombosed, hemorrhagic) atheromatous lesions. Although the progression from fatty streaks through fibrous plaques and complicated atheromatous lesions cannot be documented longitudinally in humans, such progression is presumed to occur.5,6 Long-range prevention of atherosclerosis should begin in childhood or adolescence.4View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780750674188000057Chronic Cardiac FailureNeil D. Gillespie, ... Allan D. Struthers, in Brocklehurst's Textbook of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology (Seventh Edition), 2010PATHOPHYSIOLOGYAs noted, the pathophysiology of heart failure is multifactorial, especially in older patients in whom hypertensive heart disease and valvular heart disease are more common. There may be structural abnormalities within the heart together with overcompensatory mechanisms in the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the peripheral vasculature. Although there are specific changes in the cardiovascular system with age, (see Chapter 14) such as increased calcification, increased myocardial fibrosis, and reduced ventricular compliance,32 most elderly patients with heart failure have additional pathology to explain their symptoms. In patients with heart failure due to ischemia, remodeling can result in alterations in the shape and morphology of the left ventricle with ultimate left ventricular dilatation and a large end-diastolic volume.33 In addition to changes in the structure of the left ventricle, many elderly patients have associated calcific degeneration of both the aortic and mitral valves, with functional and hemodynamically significant consequences.34 The cardiomyopathies35 are also a small but significant cause of heart failure in older patients, although the widely seen asymmetrical septal hypertrophy itself is not of great significance.36 In hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, the increase in collagen content of the ventricular wall and associated myocardial fibrosis may lead to diastolic filling abnormalities,37 which may contribute to the symptoms of heart failure, and represent a major pathophysiologic substrate for the phenomenon of heart failure with preserved systolic function (HPSF). In addition, loss of atrial contraction can result in significant hemodynamic deteriorations as atrial systole has an increased importance in the older patients when left ventricular wall stiffness is increased.38In a healthy person, cardiac output is influenced directly by stroke volume and heart rate. In the failing heart, stroke volume is maintained by increasing the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume, which is the basis of Starling’s law of the heart. However, eventually at very high left ventricular end-diastolic volumes there will be no subsequent compensatory increase in cardiac output. One of the aims of heart failure treatment is to minimize increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, so that cardiac output can be maintained and so that subsequent tissue oxygenation is adequate for perfusion of the vital organs.The autonomic nervous system and the neuroendocrine systems initially support the failing heart, but ultimately the compensatory mechanisms may themselves prove harmful. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can result in increased levels of angiotensin and aldosterone in the heart, kidney, brain, and vascular system, with undesirable consequences.39 Furthermore, the associated high levels of plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline (epinephrine and norepinephrine) are associated with a poor prognosis due to deleterious effects on myocardial function, autonomic balance, and peripheral vascular function.40Much of the fluid overload and edema in heart failure is a result of the effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the kidney, and reduced bradykinin may be associated with increased vasoconstriction. Changes in the morphology of skeletal muscle may explain the fatigability seen in heart failure patients over and above that expected with reduced tissue blood supply.41 Disruption of the microvasculature is also seen with impaired endothelial function.42 These changes are usually consequences of the disease process and not merely related to age, although in extremely old patients with mild symptoms of cardiac failure, true pathologic processes and age-related processes may be difficult to differentiate.Such age-related changes include a reduction of cardiac output on exercise, an increase in end-systolic volume, a decrease in ejection fraction with exercise, and a reduced heart rate with exercise.43 It is important to note, however, that heart failure is a disease with systemic effects; derangements of immune function cause a proinflammatory response that may in itself be cardiotoxic and contributes to the development of anemia; circulating cytokines may also help to drive the prominent skeletal myopathy that accompanies heart failure and is in fact the major cause of tiredness and breathlessness in heart failure patients. This skeletal myopathy in turn causes abnormalities of ergoreceptor function that drive further sympathetic nervous system activation. Disturbance of lung architecture and gas exchange are seen in the lungs of heart failure patients even in the absence of overt fluid overload—a further contributor to the symptoms of heart failure.Most of the established treatments for heart failure are in patients with systolic dysfunction. Even so, there are many elderly patients with normal systolic function who have symptoms and signs compatible with heart failure. Conversely, many elderly patients have these “diastolic abnormalities” on echocardiography but no symptoms of heart failure. The relative clinical significance of the diastolic abnormalities in these patients is unclear. They may go on to develop subsequent heart failure as a result of atrial fibrillation or systolic dysfunction, or may have intermittent episodes of mild cardiac decompensation possibly as a result of silent myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, echocardiographically determined measures of diastolic dysfunction are critically dependent on the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Such variables include transmitral flow velocities (the E to A ratio), the isovolumic relaxation time.44 Further work is needed to establish the clinical usefulness of these measures and newer echocardiographic indices such as measures of longitudinal systolic function.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416062318100406Perioperative Hypertension: Preparing the Hypertensive Patient for Anesthesia for SurgeryPierre Foëx, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007ADMISSION BLOOD PRESSURE AND OUTCOMEIf it is accepted that hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular complications of anesthesia, is this the result of the presence of hypertensive heart disease or does it relate closely to the level of blood pressure at the time of admission for surgery? In 1979, Goldman and Caldera19 examined patients with arterial hypertension who were included in their risk index.12 No significant differences were found between patients who were hypertensive at the time of surgery and those who were normotensive, treated with diuretics, or hypertensive but relatively well controlled (blood pressure below 160/100 mmHg). The absence of difference may be ascribed to two factors: (1) the study did not have the statistical power to confirm or refute an association between hypertension and outcome, and (2) very few patients had blood pressures that could be classified as stage 3 hypertension. Indeed, only 5 of 196 patients had a diastolic blood pressure higher than 111 mmHg.19 Other studies20,21 also suffered a lack of statistical power. One study showed a clear association between hypertension and perioperative myocardial re-infarction.22 Hypertension has also been shown to play a role in the risk of complications after coronary artery surgery.23Two case-control studies24,25 have examined the relationship between hypertension and cardiac death within 30 days of surgery with close matching for age, sex, and operation. There was no difference in the admission blood pressure between the patients who died and the survivors.24 This was also true when both elective and emergency operations were considered, although there was a tendency for survivors to have a higher admission blood pressure.25 While the studies suggest that high admission blood pressure does not correlate with postoperative cardiac death, the limitation of the studies, which also applies to most recent studies of hypertension in surgical patients, is that very few patients had stage 3 hypertension; most had stage 1 or 2 hypertension. Only older studies included many patients with stage 3 hypertension. In such patients cardiovascular lability is greatly increased, and there is a high risk of myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmias if they are untreated.7Today, the absence of a clear association between admission blood pressure and cardiac outcome of anesthesia and surgery may reflect changes in standards of perioperative care of these patients, changes in perioperative drug therapies, changes in standards of monitoring, or improvement in the standard of care of the hypertensive patient in the community leading to fewer patients exhibiting the complications of renal dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, or other organ damage.Medical patients with stage 3 hypertension are at a significantly increased risk of target-organ damage that is not always apparent. Unsurprisingly, a recent guideline recommends echocardiography for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy, and carotid Doppler sonography to detect carotid artery disease,26 as the presence of such target-organ damage increases the risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications.With the increase in blood pressure there is an increased incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities.27,28 In hypertensive patients, there is evidence of an association between quality of blood pressure control and the occurrence of silent postoperative myocardial ischemia (a marker for postoperative cardiovascular complications).29Most studies have not considered arterial pressure as a continuous variable, although it is well known that, in the long term, the risk of adverse outcome correlates with the severity of hypertension.30 However, when blood pressure was considered as a continuous variable in surgical patients, it became apparent that the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia increased with blood pressure: the odds ratio was 1.2 (CI=1.01-1.42) for each 10-mmHg increase in systolic pressure.31 This observation indicates that in surgical patients, as in medical patients, the risk of adverse outcome increases with the level of hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500635Cardiologic Investigation of the Hypertensive PatientRobert J. MacFadyen, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Ventricular function assessmentNet systolic contractility of the left ventricle is of great prognostic value and powerfully defines cardiac event rates in hypertensive patients. The evolution of hypertensive heart disease from the state of hypertrophic changes (with generally well-preserved systolic contractility) is a complex process (see other chapters), with progressive change through to a phase of ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment. These patients tend to have unrecognized, untreated, or persistently uncontrolled hypertension, and the progression to systolic impairment of the heart is not often recognized short of acute presentation of pulmonary edema. The widely cited but poorly analyzed association of arterial hypertension to systolic left ventricular impairment suggests the presence of such a progressive change regardless of the definition or recognition of intervening coronary occlusion and ventricular infarction.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500490Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Health and DiseaseFereidoon Shahidi, in Omega-3 Oils, 2011Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular DiseaseCardiovascular disease is the common term for all diseases that affect the heart and the circulatory system, including ischemic heart disease, non-ischemic myocardial heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and valvular heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the western societies (de Lorgeril et al., 2002) and has been linked to the high fat intake, particularly saturated fat, common in western diets (Dolocek & Granditis, 1991). The hallmark of cardiovascular disease is cardiac dysfunction, which in most cases is caused by hypertension due to the narrowing of large arteries with atheromatous plaques, or the total occlusion of coronary arteries (thrombus) caused by atheromatous blockages leading to myocardial tissue necrosis. Both conditions reduce the heart's ability to pump blood and can result in either chronic or sudden heart failure.It is well known that regular consumption of fatty fish or fish oils containing n-3 long-chain PUFA lowers the rate of incidence and death from cardiovascular heart disease (Albert et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2002). The cardioprotective effects of marine oils were first postulated in the 1950s based on cross-cultural studies done on Greenland Inuits and Danish settlers of Greenland (Sinclair, 1956). These studies demonstrated that the Greenland Inuits had a significantly lower incidence of heart disease compared to the Danish settlers, despite their comparable fat intakes (40% of caloric intake) and a higher intake of dietary cholesterol. This anomaly was referred to as the ‘Eskimo Paradox’ (Bang et al., 1980). Epidemiological studies carried out in the 1970s suggested a strong correlation between the low incidence of coronary heart disease in Greenland Inuits and their high consumption of fish and marine mammals, both being rich in long chain n-3 fatty acids (Fischer & Weber, 1984). Other cross-cultural epidemiological studies among coastal Japanese and Alaskan populations lend further support to these findings, showing inverse relationships between long chain n-3 PUFA intake and cardiovascular disease (Hirai et al., 1989; Davidson et al., 1993).Although the biochemical basis for cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs remains unknown, it may be multifactorial and could collectively result in anti-arrhythmic, anti-atherogenic and decreased platelet reactivity/aggregation (anti-thrombotic). Investigations on the link between fish oils and cardiovascular disease in both animal and human models have concluded that this effect may be mediated by substrate competition between n-3 PUFA and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that produce prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Competition between n-3 PUFA and AA could result in positive health benefits because a) n-3 fatty acids inhibit the production of AA through substrate competition for the DELTA-6 desaturase, b) long chain n-3 PUFA compete with AA for incorporation into the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids thereby reducing membrane AA levels (Siess et al., 1980), and c) eicosanoids produced from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregatory effects, for example increasing the membrane EPA/AA ratio shifts eicosanoid production from the pro-aggregatory eicosanoids PGI2 and TXA2 towards the anti-aggregatory TXA3 in platelets (Coker & Parratt, 1985) and PGI3 in endothelial cells (Fischer & Weber, 1984). These actions would result in vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation, both having anti-thrombotic effects.The potential anti-arrhythmic properties of n-3 PUFAs, such as ALA, EPA, and DHA, have been examined in animal models. In one such study, intravenous infusion of either fish oil or pure n-3 fatty acids in exercising dogs before an experimentally induced coronary artery obstruction reduced sudden cardiac death by preventing ventricular fibrillation (Billmann et al., 2000). The mechanisms of the antiarrhythmic effects of n-3 PUFAs have been further explored using spontaneously contracting cultured cardiac myocytes isolated from rats (Kang & Leaf, 2000). The cultured rat myocytes were induced to fibrillation using various toxic agents such as ouabain, beta-adrenergic agonists, and high Ca2+ concentrations added to the bathing medium. EPA and DHA added at low doses of 5–15 mu mol/L in the bathing medium inhibited the expected fibrillation when the toxic agents were added to the media (de Lorgeril et al., 1998). Interestingly, when the added EPA and DPA were removed from the culture media using delipidated bovine serum albumin, the cultured myocytes returned to fibrillation. Thus, n-3 PUFAs at low concentrations are able to modulate the activity of specific ion channels in myocardial sarcolemma.One of the most effective ways to protect the myocardium from ischemic/reperfusion injury is by inhibition of the transmembrane Na+/H+ antiport exchanger. This transmembrane antiport system maintains the myocardial cell's pH, but during ischemia this system paradoxically participates in cell necrosis. The importance of transmembrane Na+/H+ antiport exchanger in ischemic heart disease was shown in a clinical trial using a specific Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor caporide (Theroux et al., 2000). The inhibitor showed a potential benefit in reducing the risk of cardiac death as long as it was taken prior to the ischemic event (Amusquivar et al., 2000). It has recently been shown that EPA and DHA at concentrations of 25–100 mu M inhibited the Na÷/H+ antiport exchanger in isolated cardiomyocytes and, thus, could protect the myocardium from arrhythmias and cell death during ischemic events. This effect was limited to long chain n-3 fatty acids, as LA and ALA showed no significant effects on the Na+/H+ exchanger (Goel et al., 2002). Although the role of ALA in the prevention of arrhythmia caused by ischemia or during reperfusion remains unclear, the metabolic conversion of ALA to EPA is thought to mediate any of the cardioprotective effects of ALA, and at least one study using a canine model revealed cardioprotective effects with ALA (Chaudry et al., 1994).The “diet and reinfarction trial (DART)” was the earliest controlled trial that examined the effects of dietary intervention in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (Burr et al., 1989). The study included 2033 Welsh men who had recovered from an earlier heart attack and were allocated to one of two groups that received or did not receive advice on each of three dietary factors, namely reduced fat intake and an increased ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, increased intake of fatty fish, and increased consumption of cereal fiber. The results of this landmark trial revealed that men receiving at least 2 fatty fish meals per week (200–400 g of fish meat or 1.5 g fish oil per day through supplement) had a 29% reduction in fatal heart attack risk, which was apparent after 4 months of intervention, when compared to the non-fish consuming groups, but there was no significant reduction in the incidence of non-fatal heart attacks. The results of this study strongly suggest that marine n-3 fatty acids have a specific antiarrhythmic effect rather than anti-atherogenic or anti-thombotic effects (Burr et al., 1989).The GISSI (1999), or Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienenza nell ‘Infarto Miocardio Prevenzione, study was initiated in 1993 and carried out over 3.5 years. This multicentered trial was conducted in Italy (172 centres) and included 11,324 patients who had suffered a heart attack less than 3 months prior to recruitment. Just as in the DART study (Thun et al., 1991), the GISSI Prevenzione study revealed that marine n-3 fatty acid intake conferred early and progressive risk reductions for cardiovascular disease.The Lyon Diet Heart Study (de Lorgeril et al., 1998) conducted in France was one of the earliest intervention trials (with 204 control subjects and 219 experimental subjects), making the hypothesis that a Mediterranean diet high in ALA could reduce the relative risk of cardiovascular events and/or death in previous heart attack victims. After 1 year of study, total cardiovascular events were reduced from 34.7% in the control group to 24.5% in the fish oil group and 28% in the mustard oil group (Narayanan et al., 2001).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781893997820500049Recommended publicationsInfo iconFEBS LettersJournalCell ReportsJournalEconomics & Human BiologyJournalJournal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: BiologyJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and GynecologyJournalJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Sign in to download full-size imageFigure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ...

The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and GynecologyJournalJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Patel MD, James A. De Lemos MD, in Decision Making in Medicine (Third Edition), 2010Hypotension can result in multiorgan dysfunction if not treated immediately. As a result, diagnostic assessments and therapeutic maneuvers should occur rapidly and simultaneously.A.Initially, a rapid assessment should be made to identify patients who are critically ill and unresponsive or who are clinically unstable. For these patients, Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocols should be immediately initiated.B.Clinical examination, laboratory data, and noninvasive tests should be used to distinguish between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic causes of hypotension because the management of each one is markedly different. Careful attention to volume and perfusion status can help differentiate etiologies.C.Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization can help differentiate among different causes of hypotension. PA catheters should be used prudently because there is no indication from clinical trials that they provide clinical benefit when used routinely. (CO, cardiac output; PCWP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; SVR, systemic vascular resistance; PVR, pulmonary vascular resistance.)D.Cardiogenic shock most commonly results from large myocardial infarctions (MIs; >40% of left ventricle) leading to pump failure. Mechanical complications of MI, including right ventricular dysfunction, acute mitral regurgitation, septal rupture, and free-wall rupture, can also lead to cardiogenic shock. In patients with mechanical complications, urgent surgical repair is needed. Other cardiac causes of cardiogenic hypotension include pericardial tamponade, severe obstructive valvular heart disease, and progression of a chronic cardiomyopathy. Urgent echocardiography is particularly helpful in delineating the causes of cardiogenic shock.E.In cardiogenic shock from acute MI, urgent coronary revascularization is indicated, often with support of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). For initial stabilization and for treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock, inotropic support may be initiated with dobutamine or dopamine (dobutamine is generally preferred because dopamine has significant chronotropic and vasoconstrictive properties that may worsen cardiac ischemia). If hypotension still persists, other drugs such as milrinone or norepinephrine may be tried.F.Causes of vasodilatory hypotension include sepsis, adrenal crisis, drug effects, anaphylaxis, and neurogenic shock and require treatment of the underlying pathologic process and supportive treatment with volume resuscitation and IV vasopressors. Notably, volume resuscitation is the first-line supportive treatment for sepsis because sepsis is associated with hypovolemic hypotension. However, sepsis can also be associated with a cardiomyopathy, and this may limit the amount of volume resuscitation that can be administered.G.Obstructive hypotension is most commonly caused by massive pulmonary thromboembolism. Treatment options include thrombolytic therapy or surgical embolectomy. Supportive measures involving volume resuscitation, vasopressors, and inotropes should be used cautiously because they may augment right ventricular strain.H.The management of hypovolemic hypotension should involve volume resuscitation and treatment of the cause of intravascular volume loss (e.g., bleeding, diarrhea, third-space sequestration). Crystalloids, colloid-containing solutions, or blood products can be used for volume resuscitation; however, there is no clinical benefit to using colloid-containing solutions over crystalloids.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323041072500296The Neonate With Relative Adrenal Insufficiency and Vasopressor ResistanceErika F Fernandez, in Hemodynamics and Cardiology (Third Edition), 2019AbstractHypotension in the neonate is defined by low blood pressure associated with decreased systemic and organ blood flow. In a proportion of critically ill neonates, especially preterm neonates, hypotension is associated with adrenal insufficiency. Accordingly, corticosteroids have been increasingly used in the treatment of systemic hypotension in this patient population. Although recent information has led to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and treatment strategies of neonatal hypotension associated with adrenal insufficiency, more data are needed to understand the benefits and risks of the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of adrenal insufficiency and the associated hypotension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323533669000302Noncardiac Surgery in the Patient with Cardiovascular Disease: Preoperative Evaluation and Perioperative CareHOWARD H. WEITZ MD, in Medical Management of the Surgical Patient (Third Edition), 2008PERIOPERATIVE HYPOTENSIONPerioperative hypotension may result in myocardial ischemia and is a predictor of postoperative cardiac morbidity. A perioperative decrease of mean arterial blood pressure of more than 20 mm Hg has been shown to increase postoperative cardiac complications. The most common causes of perioperative hypotension are intravascular volume depletion and excessive vasodilation. Hypotension may be induced by anesthetic agents. Spinal anesthesia may result in hypotension related to vasodilation. Several of the inhalational anesthetic agents (e.g., isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane) may cause hypotension by peripheral vasodilation as well as by myocardial depression. Other causes of perioperative hypotension include MI, pulmonary embolus, and sepsis. Hypotension caused by volume depletion or vasodilation is best treated by volume expansion. When clinically significant vasodilation-induced hypotension does not respond to this approach, a peripheral vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine) should be considered. Hypotension resulting from direct myocardial depression may be treated with inotropic agents such as dopamine, dobutamine, and milrinone.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416023852500081Vital SignsBrian K. Peterson, in Physical Rehabilitation, 2007HYPOTENSIONHypotension is generally defined as a systolic BP of 90 mm Hg or lower, although in some adults such a low BP may be normal.1 Signs and symptoms of clinically significant hypotension include tachycardia, dizziness, mental confusion, restlessness, cool, clammy, pale or cyanotic skin, and syncope.29 Low BP in conjunction with symptoms of shock or circulatory collapse indicates a dangerous condition that can rapidly progress to death unless treated.2 Shock may be caused by a reduction in BP as a result of a wide range of causes, including hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, burns, myocardial infarction, and overwhelming infection. Signs and symptoms of shock include hypotension, tachycardia, cold clammy skin, dizziness, blurred vision, and apprehension. The presence of low BP and any of these symptoms may indicate onset of shock or circulatory collapse and should be taken seriously, including ensuring immediate medical attention.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780721603612500259High-Risk Percutaneous Coronary InterventionsMichael J. Lim, ... William M. Suh, in Interventional Cardiac Catheterization Handbook (Third Edition), 2013HypotensionHypotension may result from myocardial ischemia, coronary perforation with cardiac tamponade, arrhythmia, contrast- or medication-induced anaphylaxis, or acute occult bleeding (e.g., retroperitoneal hematoma). This differential diagnosis of hypotension must be evaluated quickly and therapy directed to the cause of the hypotension. After the first step of aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline, support blood pressure with inotropic agents such as dopamine (initial starting infusion rate of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min depending on degree of hypotension) or bolus dose norepinephrine (2.5–5 mcg IV boluses as needed). An emergent echocardiogram will help assess for cardiac tamponade or valvular dysfunction. The treatment of anaphylaxis is discussed below (Table 12-10).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323080576000124Transitional Hemodynamics and Pathophysiology of Peri/Intraventricular HemorrhageShahab Noori, ... Istvan Seri, in Hemodynamics and Cardiology (Third Edition), 2019HypotensionHypotension is common in preterm infants during transition. It is discussed in detail in Chapter 3, suffice to say that there are many reasons for a preterm infant to be hypotensive during the transitional period. These include postnatal maladaptation superimposed on immaturity of the cardiovascular system, inadequate compensation for a PDA shunt, prevalence of relative adrenal insufficiency, increased rate of sepsis, acidosis, and the detrimental impact of inappropriate ventilator support on neonatal hemodynamics. Hypotension has long been recognized as a risk factor for P/IVH.57,58 Given the fact that hypotension is a hallmark of uncompensated shock, the association between hypotension and P/IVH is not surprising. However, the uncertainty about the definition of hypotension and the influence of other coexisting variables (see Chapter 3) make it difficult to propose a “safe” blood pressure range.Over the past decade, there has been an increasing concern about the possible role of treatment of hypotension in the occurrence of P/IVH and poor neurodevelopmental outcome associated with hypotension.59-61 This is indeed a possibility, at least theoretically. By definition, hypotensive preterm infants are outside the CBF autoregulatory range where cerebral perfusion is pressure passive.62,63 Therefore, inappropriate titration of vasopressor-inotropes can increase blood pressure and brain blood flow62,64 and thus, in theory, increase the risk of P/IVH (see Chapter 3). However, of note is that although careful, stepwise titration of vasopressor-inotropes for hypotension restores brain blood flow along with the blood pressure, CBF autoregulation does not regain its functionality for a period of time.62,64 Yet there are data, although not conclusive, on the potential beneficial effects of careful titration of cardiovascular medications.58,65,66 It is likely that the underlying pathophysiology of brain injury associated with hypotension is multifactorial and that low CBF due to low perfusion pressure, inappropriate treatment, and titration of vasopressor-inotropes resulting in intermittent cerebral hypo- and hyperperfusion and other coexisting factors independent of hypotension all contribute in varying degrees to the development of P/IVH. The fact that hypotension is almost always treated,67 albeit at different thresholds, makes establishing causality for adverse outcomes and defining the extent of contribution of various aspects of clinical care to the development of P/IVH in response to hypotension nearly impossible. There are many challenges in designing a study to ascertain the impact of each of these factors in the pathogenesis of P/IVH and poor neurodevelopmental outcome. These include the inability to utilize a physiology-based and individualized definition of hypotension for each patient, the heterogeneous etiology and pathophysiology of hypotension (i.e., abnormality in preload, contractility, afterload and/or vascular tone dysregulation), and the complexity of selecting the appropriate treatment for the given pathophysiology and clinical presentation. In addition, given the strong belief among neonatologists of the harmful effect of hypotension, conducting randomized control trials with a no treatment arm appears not feasible.67 However, several ongoing trials are investigating the effect of hypotension on outcome by using different thresholds for treatment or by incorporating advanced monitoring technology to enhance the identification of the threshold of hypotension (see Chapter 3).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323533669000065Prehospital and Emergency Department Care of the Patient with Acute StrokeOpeolu Adeoye, Arthur Pancioli, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011HypotensionHypotension can decrease cerebral perfusion pressure and subsequently lead to a significant extension of an area of cerebral infarction. During an acute stroke, perfusion of ischemic areas is directly related to the mean arterial pressure. Hypotension should be evaluated and aggressively treated. As an initial intervention, putting the patient’s head down flat can increase blood pressure and cerebral perfusion and can sometimes result in clinical improvement. In addition, hypotension can be treated with IV fluids, inotropic agents, or vasopressors as necessary to maintain perfusion and prevent extension of an infarct. Physicians must search for a cause for a patient’s relative hypotension. The emergency physician must be constantly vigilant for other diseases, such as AMI, gastrointestinal bleeding, occult trauma, aortic dissection, and sepsis.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141605478810048XEmergency Airway ManagementNazish K. Hashmi, ... Raquel R. Bartz, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Third Edition), 2019Hypotension.Hypotension in the postintubation setting is due to the combination of a myriad of hemodynamic alterations. The vasodilatory and occasional myocardial depressant effects of induction agents—as well as attenuation of the sympathetic response from hypoxia and hypercarbia—may contribute to hypotension. In patients with hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, and underlying myocardial depression, especially RV dysfunction, the initiation of positive pressure ventilation and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) will also contribute to postintubation hypotension.52 Positive pressure ventilation will decrease venous return to the right heart, which will lower the preload. It also increases RV afterload, resulting in reduced LV filling pressures and hence, decreased stroke volume. Postintubation hypotension is associated with poor outcomes and prolonged hospital length of stay, especially in traumatized and neurologically injured patients.53View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323529938000497Heart and circulatory system drugs and diureticsCorinna Weber-Schöndorfer, in Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation (Second Edition), 20072.8.15 Hypotension and antihypotensivesHypotension (low blood pressure) may occur in some healthy people with a normal heart and blood vessels. Symptoms usually occur only when the blood pressure is so low that blood flow to the brain is reduced, causing dizziness and fainting. The most common type of hypotension is postural hypotension, where symptoms occur after abruptly standing or sitting. Postural hypotension is sometimes an adverse effect of drug treatment (antidepressants), or may be due to illness (diabetes mellitus), or to nerve damage that disrupts the reflexes controlling blood pressure. In the majority of cases, treatment of hypotension depends on the underlying cause.In the 1980s, particular attention was paid to the consequences of chronic hypotension in pregnancy. An increased rate of prematurity of up to 17 percent was attributed to untreated hypotension (Goeschen 1984), and treatment during pregnancy was advocated. Dihydroergotamine was considered to be more effective than the adrenergic substances, and use of this drug in hypotensive pregnant women has been reported in the German literature (Goeschen 1984). However, its use in pregnancy is controversial because of its potential oxytocic effects and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with vascular injury (Raymond 1995).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444520722500124Prehospital and Emergency Department Care of the Patient With Acute StrokeCharles E Kircher, Opeolu Adeoye, in Stroke (Seventh Edition), 2022HypotensionAcute hypotension can be detrimental to ischemic stroke patients, as CPP is directly linked to mean arterial pressure via the following equation:CPP=MAP−ICPIn patients with normal ICP (8–12 mm Hg), effort should be made to maintain a MAP of 65–70 or greater to allow for adequate CPP. Some patients will have stroke symptoms triggered by hypotension or “pressure-dependent” exams or lesions where maintaining a higher (or normal) MAP/SBP target results in clinical improvement. These patients may experience fluctuation of symptoms even when the BP is within a “normal” range and may benefit from higher MAP targets. However, induced hypertension for patients with AIS is of uncertain benefit.1Regardless of the goal SBP or MAP, fluid resuscitation and flat positioning are the first maneuvers to attempt for acute hypotension. Emergency clinicians must keep a broad differential diagnosis for hypotension and shock even in the face of acute stroke symptoms. Arterial dissections, hypovolemic shock, and sepsis can all produce stroke mimics in association with hypotension, or directly contribute to formation of embolic strokes. If hypotension does not respond to fluids, vasopressors and/or blood products are necessary to restore optimal organ and CPPs. Bedside echocardiography can be useful to evaluate patients with persistent hypotension and, when performed by a skilled operator, can narrow the differential diagnosis in these complex patients.75–77View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323694247000521Recommended publicationsInfo iconHealth & PlaceJournalChestJournalDental AbstractsJournalInternational Journal of Law and PsychiatryJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

      "ScienceDirectJournals & BooksSearchRegisterSign inOrthostatic HypotensionOrthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10mmHg from a sitting to a standing position.From: Heart and Toxins, 2015Related terms:Combination TherapyPatientInpatientFaintnessBlood PressureDizzinessDrug TherapyView all TopicsAdd to MendeleySet alertAbout this pageOrthostatic HypotensionItalo Biaggioni, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease (Third Edition), 2018Evaluation of the Patient with Orthostatic HypotensionOH is defined as a sustained reduction of SBP of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 10 mm Hg within 3 min of standing, or head-up tilt to at least 60 degrees.14 In hypertensive patients, a reduction in SBP of 30 mm Hg is considered a more appropriate criterion for orthostatic hypotension because the magnitude of the orthostatic blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.14 Typical symptoms of OH are lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, dimming of vision, and shoulder (“coat hanger”) pain. Patients may be asymptomatic or may have difficulty identifying their symptoms. It is useful to consider that, as a general rule, symptoms should never start while the patient is supine, should occur mostly while standing, and should be quickly relived by seating or lying down. Symptoms tend to be worse in hot environments and if patients stand still. The severity of OH is also greater in the morning, so much so that the diagnosis of OH is more likely to be made if orthostatic vitals are taken in the morning than in the afternoon.15The evaluation and diagnosis of OH can be done at the bedside. Autonomic testing, often restricted to specialized units, is helpful to assess the presence and severity of autonomic impairment (neurogenic OH). It is, however, not essential. Measuring orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate is often all that is needed. A significant decrease in orthostatic blood pressure that is not associated with an appropriate increase in heart rate is indicative of neurogenic OH. Another practical alternative to specialized testing is to clinically try to improve OH by removing factors that can trigger or aggravate OH (see below under management); any significant OH that remains is likely to have an important neurogenic component.The list of etiologies that cause neurogenic OH is long but most become apparent after a comprehensive evaluation. In principle, any disease that causes peripheral neuropathy can cause autonomic neuropathy and neurogenic OH. In practice, diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common culprit. Tight glucose control can delay the progression of autonomic neuropathy in type 1 diabetes,16 but the evidence for type 2 diabetes is less clear. B12 deficiency should be ruled out because its treatment can lead to improvement of OH.17 Special attention should be given to patients that develop severe OH with a subacute onset and rapid progression, for they often have an autoimmune or paraneoplastic syndrome; in some cases neurogenic OH can be the presenting problem which leads to the diagnosis of the underlying disease.18View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323429733000421Orthostatic HypotensionLaura Barritt, in xPharm: The Comprehensive Pharmacology Reference, 2007EtiologyOrthostatic hypotension may result from non-neurogenic causes such as cardiac impairment, hypovolemia, and venous pooling. Neurogenic causes of this condition are associated with central or peripheral autonomic disorders. Non-neurogenic Causes Acute onset non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is one of the most common forms of the condition. It is frequently caused by a decrease in intravascular blood volume due to, vomiting, dehydration or hemorrhage. Acute orthostatic hypotension may also accompany myocardial infarcts. Chronic forms of non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are usually associated with disorders causing cardiac impairment, anemia, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus, or vascular insufficiencies such as varicose veins Hermosillo et al (2001). Numerous drugs cause orthostatic hypotension by impairing autonomic reflex mechanisms or by inducing excessive diuresis and vasodilation. Included are loop diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, nitrate preparations, antihypertensives, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, phenothiazine antipsychotics, barbiturates, levodopa, quinidine, and alcoholMathias and Kimber (1999). Neurogenic Causes Acute causes of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, such as primary idiopathic pandysautonomia, are rare and reflect a breakdown of autonomic regulatory mechanisms. Both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems are usually affected in this condition. Chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is often attributed to neurodegenerative diseases that interrupt the sympathetic reflex arc and impair the normal adrenergic responses to standing. Primary causes of chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension include pure autonomic failure, such as that associated with Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome or idiopathic orthostatic hypotension, and multiple system atrophy, a characteristic of Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, or striatonigral degeneration Mathias (1996). In both cases, orthostatic hypotension is a central feature caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction associated with low levels of norepinephrine. Secondary causes of chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are usually associated with diseases or syndromes that are inherited or acquired. Secondary forms of autonomic failure due to systemic disease are a more common cause of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Other conditions with impaired autonomic function include diabetes mellitus, Guillain-Barre syndrome, tabes dorsalis, syringomyelia, and amyloidosisMathias and Kimber (1999).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080552323606749ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSIONHoracio Kaufmann, Italo Biaggioni, in Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience, 2007DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION OF ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSIONOrthostatic hypotension produces a characteristic clinical history. Symptoms of lightheadedness and tunnel vision occur on standing, never while the person is lying down, and are always relieved immediately on sitting or lying down, because cerebral blood flow is passively restored. Failure to meet these criteria suggests other causes of impaired consciousness (e.g., hypoglycemia, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias).16 In patients with diabetes or other peripheral neuropathies, proprioceptive abnormalities lead to feeling of unsteadiness that patients refer as dizziness, which may wrongly suggest orthostatic hypotension. In addition to the classic lightheadedness with blurred vision and syncope, symptoms of chronic orthostatic hypotension may include vague generalized weakness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain in the shoulders and back of the neck (coat hanger pain).Many patients with chronic autonomic failure can tolerate very low orthostatic blood pressures with few symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, perhaps because their cerebral autoregulatory capacity is well preserved.17 However, physical exercise, prolonged standing, the postprandial state, or mild volume depletion exacerbates orthostatic hypotension and invariably triggers symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, including presyncope or syncope.The diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension relies on simple measurements of blood pressure and heart rate after the patient has lain down for 5 to 10 minutes and after 1 to 3 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension is arbitrarily defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg and in diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing, in association with symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion.18 On occasion, the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension may require repeated measurements of blood pressure throughout the day. In patients with autonomic impairment, the severity of orthostatic hypotension is worse early in the morning or about 30 minutes after a meal compared to the rest of the day.Concomitant measurements of heart rate are crucial for adequate interpretation of results. Side effects of medications are arguably the most common causes of orthostatic hypotension. The most common culprits are tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, nitrates, and α blockers used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy. In these cases, there is usually a compensatory increase in heart rate in association with orthostatic hypotension. In contrast, the presence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension without an adequate compensatory increase in heart rate is sufficient clinical indication of autonomic failure (Fig. 28-3). The diagnosis can be easily confirmed with simple measurements of heart rate and blood pressure (Table 28-1). No single test completely differentiates patients with autonomic failure from age-matched control subjects, but together these tests provide a reliable indicator of the presence and severity of cardiovascular autonomic impairment.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323033541500328Postural HypotensionMichael J. Aminoff, in Neurology and General Medicine (Fourth Edition), 2008Alterations of Effective Blood VolumePostural hypotension can occur because of loss of effective blood volume. Normal adults can withstand the loss of 500 ml of blood or bodily fluids with few if any symptoms, but greater volume depletion may occur acutely for a variety of reasons (e.g., hemorrhage or burns) and cause a postural drop in blood pressure. Hyponatremia and Addison's disease may also lead to an absolute reduction in blood volume. Postural hypotension may occur owing to venous pooling in patients with severe varicose veins or congenital absence of venous valves or because of poor peripheral resistance and reduced muscle tone in patients with paralyzed limbs. Similarly, it may occur during the late stages of pregnancy owing to obstructed venous return by the gravid uterus. Marked vasodilatation, such as occurs in the heat or with the use of certain drugs or alcohol, sometimes causes postural hypotension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443067075500110Orthostatic HypotensionI. Biaggioni, H. Kaufmann, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences (Second Edition), 2014DefinitionOrthostatic hypotension is arbitrarily defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 min of standing. It is best characterized clinically as any decrease in arterial blood pressure that produces symptoms such as lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain in the back of the neck. If the fall in blood pressure is pronounced, cerebral blood flow is compromised and transient loss of consciousness (i.e., syncope) may occur. Symptoms never occur while supine but usually occur shortly after standing and are always relieved immediately on sitting or lying down. Failure to meet these criteria should make the physician rule out other causes of transient loss of consciousness (e.g., hypoglycemia, arrhythmias, or transient ischemic attacks). If patients have symptoms suggestive of, but do not have documented, orthostatic hypotension, repeated measurements of blood pressure should be performed. Occasionally, patients may have delayed orthostatic hypotension, which is only apparent after they stand for 10–30 min.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123851574005078Postural HypotensionWilliam A.

Sodeman M.D., in Instructions for Geriatric Patients (Third Edition), 2005General InformationPostural hypotension, which physicians also call orthostatic hypotension, is a fall in the blood pressure that occurs when one goes from a lying to a standing position. This fall in blood pressure when rising can cause weakness, light-headedness, dizziness, or syncope (fainting). It is a problem that emerges with increasing frequency with advancing age.There are multiple causes. Vascular and nervous system changes with age can, alone, produce this reaction in the blood pressure. Diseases that affect the cardiovascular system and the nervous system can do so as well. A number of endocrine diseases can also be involved. Many drugs may produce this response as an effect or a side effect.Your doctor will undertake a comprehensive review of your medical history and physical examination to look for possible causes. A number of laboratory and other tests may be required to identify or eliminate possible causes.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416002031501049Autonomic DysfunctionL. Norcliffe-Kaufmann, H. Kaufmann, in Encyclopedia of Movement Disorders, 2010Cardiovascular abnormalitiesOrthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a fall of at least 20 mmHg systolic and 10 mmHg diastolic BP accompanied by symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion within 3 min of standing. In the autonomic synucleinopathies, OH is typically caused by impaired sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction in the systemic circulation, a reflex response that normally compensates for the gravitational fluid shifts to the lower body when in the upright position (Figure 1). Around 40% of patients with PD have OH. In patients with PD who have OH, beat-to-beat recordings of BP and heart rate during prolonged upright tilt reveal a progressive decline in BP with a smaller than normal increase in heart rate (Figure 2). If cerebral perfusion is significantly reduced syncope occurs. BP recordings during the Valsalva maneuver are also characteristically abnormal. The normal overshoot in BP after release of the strain (i.e., phase IV) is absent (Figure 3). This characteristic profile distinguishes OH due to autonomic failure from OH due to other causes, such as dehydration.Figure 1. A schematic diagram of the baroreceptor reflex. The baroreflex is a negative feedback loop that regulates arterial BP. Arterial baroreceptors are located in the walls of the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and coronary vasculature and relay sensory information to the CNS through the glossopharyngeal (IXth) and vagus (Xth) nerves. These afferent neurons have their cell bodies in the petrosal (IXth) and nodose ganglia (X). The first synapse of the baroreflex is in the medulla, at the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), where baroreceptive information is integrated with inputs from other cardiovascular brain centers including the area postrema. Excitatory inputs project from the NTS to neurons in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVL). In turn the CVL provides an inhibitory influence to the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVL), which contains pacemaker neurons that generate sympathetic tone. RVL neurons project caudally through the spinal cord to synapse with preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the IML column. Axons from preganglionic sympathetic neurons leave the spinal cord to synapse in peripheral ganglia with postganglionic sympathetic neurons, which release norepinephrine at target organs. This results in arteriolar vasoconstriction, venoconstriction, tachycardia, and an increase in cardiac contractility. Parasympathetic tone is also modulated by the baroreflex. Projections from the NTS to the nucleus ambiguus (NA) excite preganglionic cardiac parasympathetic nerves. In addition, neurons in the NTS project rostrally to the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus and control vasopressin (AVP) release. An increase in systemic BP stretches arterial baroreceptors and increases the firing rate of afferent fibers. This activates NTS and CVL neurons, which in turn inhibits RVL neurons and ‘withdraws’ sympathetic outflow. Activation of the NTS also results is activation of the NA and an increase in parasympathetic outflow together with inhibition of vasopressin secretion. The end result is systemic vasodilatation, bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac contractility, which restores BP back to ‘baseline’ levels. In general, sympathetic withdrawal is accompanied by parasympathetic activation and vice versa. Sympathetic activation to different organs is not homogenously distributed and depends on the stimuli and afferent pathways involved. For example, mental stress induces sympathetic activation and increases BP, but causes vasodilatation in the forearm vasculature.Figure 2. Beat-to-beat BP and electrocardiographic RR intervals during passive head-up tilt in a patient with autonomic failure. Note hypertension when supine and a precipitous fall in BP upon head up tilt. There is little shortening of RR intervals despite the pronounced fall in BP. Figurines denote posture.Figure 3. Beat-to-beat BP and electrocardiographic RR intervals during a Valsalva maneuver in a patient with autonomic failure and a healthy control. Note the absence of BP ‘overshoot’ after release of the strain in the patient with autonomic failure.OH in PD is related to the duration and severity of the disease and is often worsened by treatment with levodopa and dopaminergic agonists. However, neither of these drugs is the primary cause of OH in PD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123741059000149SyncopeRose Anne Kenny, in Brocklehurst's Textbook of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology (Seventh Edition), 2010PathophysiologyOrthostatic or postural hypotension is arbitrarily defined as either a 20 mm Hg fall in systolic blood pressure or a 10 mm Hg fall in diastolic blood pressure on assuming an upright posture from a supine position. Orthostatic hypotension implies abnormal blood pressure homeostasis and is a frequent observation with advancing age. Prevalence of postural hypotension varies between 4% and 33% among community living older persons depending on the methodology used. Higher prevalence and larger falls in systolic blood pressure have been reported with increasing age and often signify general physical frailty. Orthostatic hypotension is an important cause of syncope, accounting for 14% of all diagnosed cases in a large series. In a tertiary referral clinic dealing with unexplained syncope, dizziness, and falls, 32% of patients over age 65 years had orthostatic hypotension as a possible attributable cause of symptoms.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416062318100467Orthostatic Hypotension☆L.C. Barritt, in Reference Module in Biomedical Sciences, 2014ClassificationOrthostatic hypotension is functionally classified as non-neurogenic or neurogenic based on symptoms and etiology. Both non-neurogenic and neurogenic causes may be further classified as acute or chronic based on the onset of the condition. Neurogenic disorders that produce orthostatic hypotension are further subdivided into primary and secondary causes (Consensus Committee of the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, 1996). Primary neurogenic causes of orthostatic hypotension, which are usually idiopathic, are disturbances affecting either the central or peripheral autonomic nervous system. Secondary causes are associated with systemic disorders that may impair autonomic regulation of blood pressure (Mathias and Kimber, 1999).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012801238305193XThe Neurology of AgingRichard K. Olney, Michael J. Aminoff, in Neurology and General Medicine (Fourth Edition), 2008Orthostatic HypotensionOrthostatic hypotension is present in 10 to 30 percent of subjects older than 65 years if defined as a decline of more than 20 mmHg in systolic pressure or of more than 10 mmHg in diastolic pressure for more than 1 minute. The presence of orthostatic hypotension is a risk factor for increased mortality over 4 years that is independent of other associated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and coronary artery disease.106 Orthostatic hypotension most commonly has a non-neurogenic cause; medication such as antihypertensives and tricyclic antidepressants are often responsible. A significant factor underlying the increasing frequency of orthostatic hypotension with age may be diminution in baroreceptor sensitivity with advancing age.107 The elderly have not only less reduction in heart rate in response to pressor drugs107 but also a blunted increase in heart rate with standing even in the absence of hypotension. In addition to blunting of the autonomic response as a predisposing factor to orthostatic hypotension, compensatory mechanisms that restrict volume depletion are also impaired in the elderly.Syncope becomes more common with advancing age, and orthostatic hypotension is a common cause.108 However, this diagnosis is accepted only when postural changes in blood pressure can be demonstrated by examination. Management of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension is initially with nonpharmacological methods; patients are encouraged to make slow position changes, to increase their fluid and salt intake, to use compression garments, and to elevate the head of the bed. Pharmacological treatment is typically with fludrocortisone or midodrine. Further discussion of autonomic function in the elderly is provided in Chapter 8.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443067075500602Recommended publicationsInfo iconThe American Journal of MedicineJournalGeriatric NursingJournalNursing Clinics of North AmericaJournalThe Journal for Nurse PractitionersJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

      "ScienceDirectJournals & BooksSearchRegisterSign inHypertensive Heart DiseaseHHD can be defined as the cardiomyopathy that results from the response of the heart to the stress imposed on the left ventricle by the progressively increasing arterial pressure.From: Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Related terms:AngiotensinAldosteroneMyocardial InfarctionVentricle of HeartEpicardial Coronary ArteriesLeft VentricleTissuesKidneysBlood PressureView all TopicsAdd to MendeleySet alertAbout this pageHeart FailureS.M. Hamza, ... J.R.B. Dyck, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Disease development and clinical presentationHHD is characterized by an abnormal thickening of the muscular wall of the LV, which is termed ‘left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),’ and generally occurs in the absence of any other causes except high arterial pressure in the case of HHD. This general hypertrophy is also accompanied by complex changes in the cellular composition of the heart muscle – these cellular changes are largely responsible for the structural remodeling that occurs in the heart. This remodeling is not only due to mechanical stress on the heart as it works harder against increasing blood pressure but also involves nerve signaling, hormones, and other biological mediators such as cytokines. In addition, these changes occur in both the heart cells themselves and the surrounding portions of the heart tissue. The essential criterion, which defines HHD, is the presence of LVH in the absence of a cause other than arterial hypertension. LV cavity dimension is typically normal, but LV mass is usually increased due to increased wall thickness (termed ‘concentric hypertrophy’). Despite this common presentation, ‘eccentric hypertrophy’ is also noted in HHD patients in whom the LV cavity size is larger than normal and wall thickness is much thinner. Although LVH is a key feature of HHD, it is also important to note that in the very early stages of HHD, it is now recognized that some impairment in ventricle relaxation, or diastolic dysfunction, is present even before there is any sign of development of LVH (Figure 3). In this early stage, systolic function is still preserved, and only diastolic dysfunction is evident. This distinction of the early phase of HHD is especially critical when considering early detection and treatment of heart dysfunction in this patient group, as will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.Sign in to download full-size imageFigure 3. Schematic representation of the development of hypertensive-heart disease (HHD). LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.LVH is due to growth of heart cells and changes in the surrounding tissue or ‘ECM.’ These changes allow the heart to adapt to the increased workload and attempt to normalize wall stress during the contraction phase of the heart cycle, or ‘systole.’ Over time, however, the degree of heart cell growth in response to this mechanical stress becomes out of proportion such that the increase in LV mass is much higher compared to the underlying circulatory, or hemodynamic, stimulus. This exaggerated response of the heart cells may be due to genetic influences (i.e., variations of the ACE gene) and environmental factors such as obesity, increased salt intake, and diabetes, as will be discussed.In general, HHD represents a ‘true’ hypertrophic response, as there is typically an increase in heart cell size with no increase in cell number. This hypertrophic response can be divided into several different categories: (1) increased transverse or longitudinal size of the cell; (2) enhanced protein synthesis, leading to new sarcomere formation and cell thickening/elongation; (3) altered gene expression; and (4) ultrastructural changes involving the cell machinery (i.e., nuclei and mitochondria).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567033049Cardiovascular BiomarkersA. Rogier van der Velde, ... Rudolf A. de Boer, in Principles of Translational Science in Medicine (Second Edition), 2015Hypertensive Heart DiseaseHypertensive heart disease is characterized by persistent pressure overload, concentric hypertrophy, with a normal ejection fraction and normal or decreased end-diastolic volume (Levy et al., 1990). These patients are more often female, are older, have a higher BMI, and more often have diabetes. With persistent, prolonged hypertension, this form of compensated hypertrophy makes the transition to heart failure with an increase in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, decreased LVEF, increased LV chamber stiffness, and impaired LV relaxation (Frohlich et al., 1992). Hypertensive heart disease can induce heart failure without a significant decrease in LVEF, and diastolic dysfunction is an important contributor in decompensated heart failure.Animal models of hypertensive heart disease include a canine nephrectomy model (Morioka and Simon, 1982), and other variants of this model are also currently used (Shapiro et al., 2008). Models using smaller animals include the SHR (Pfeffer et al., 1982), the TGR(mREN2)27 rat (Pinto et al., 2000), aortic banding (Litwin et al., 1995), or genetically modified mice (Molkentin et al., 1998).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128006870000189The Eye in HypertensionTien Yin Wong, Paul Mitchell, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Relationship with other systemic diseases and risk factorsIn addition to stroke and heart disease, hypertensive retinopathy signs have been linked with a variety of systemic conditions and vascular risk factors. Hypertensive retinopathy signs have not been consistently associated with direct measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. In the ARIC study, while controlling for blood pressure generalized arteriolar narrowing was associated with carotid artery plaque but not intima-media thickeness, AV nicking was associated with carotid artery intima-media thickness but not carotid artery plaque, and focal arteriolar narrowing was not related to either carotid artery measure.12 In both the Rotterdam Eye Study and Cardiovascular Health Study, hypertensive retinopathy signs were not related to carotid artery disease.16,18Similarly, most studies have not been able to demonstrate clear associations of hypertensive retinopathy with traditional atherosclerosis risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, or obesity.19,42,43 There are several recent studies investigating associations with novel risk markers, such as biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen),12,16,19 endothelial cell activation (von-Willebrand factor),12 and angiogenesis (vascular growth endothelial factor,44 adiponectin,45 and leptin46). The significance of these associations remains to be determined.Renal impairment is another marker of target organ damage in individuals with hypertension. The presence of microalbuminuria and renal impairment is often associated with concomitant hypertensive retinopathy.47,48 In the ARIC study, individuals who developed renal dysfunction were more likely to have moderate retinopathy as compared to those without renal dsyfunction.49 This association was independent of the shared risk factors and was seen in persons without diabetes or hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500544Cardiac FibrosisHasse Brønnum, Raghu Kalluri, in Muscle, 2012Pressure and Volume OverloadCardiac diseases manifesting in pressure overload include hypertensive heart disease and aortic valve stenosis. Pressure overload mediates hypertrophy through thickening of the left ventricular wall with little or no increase in chamber size, whereas volume overload (valvular regurgitation) results in regular wall thickness but increased chamber size (140).Cardiac fibrosis in hypertensive disease is mediated through a combination of hemodynamics (pressure overload), and cascades of inflammatory and remodeling cascades. The latter is likely to involve classic pro-fibrotic mediators, such as AngII and TGF-β. However, while the inflammation phase of myocardial infarction is highly controlled by innate mechanisms, such as the complement system and toll-like receptor signaling, adaptive immunity is a major player in hypertension (141). Hence, T cell-mediated responses, along with cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17, are major drivers of hypertension and reparative fibrosis (see above).The degree of fibrosis may vary in hypertensive heart disease. In mild conditions, the structure of the ECM is preserved despite increased collagen deposition and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Severe cases are characterized by extensive cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cell death, along with increased and disorganized ECM and even sections of replacement fibrosis (142).Experimentally, cardiac fibrosis caused by hypertension has been widely investigated in rodent models through thoracic banding (Figure 29.1a) or chemically induced by, e.g., AngII or aldosterone infusion (143).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123815101000296Atherosclerotic Cerebral Infarction in Young AdultsJosé Biller, Rima M. Dafer, in Stroke in Children and Young Adults (Second Edition), 2009PathogenesisAtherosclerosis affects millions of adults. Ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower limbs constitute major public health problems. Coronary and cerebral atherosclerotic vascular diseases are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. Atherosclerosis, although uncommon before 40 years of age, has its onset in infancy and childhood.1–4 Atherosclerosis tends to affect the large and medium-sized arteries, such as the aorta, and iliac, superficial femoral, coronary, and cerebral arteries. Autopsy studies of men in their 20s killed during wartime indicated that more than two thirds had moderately advanced coronary atherosclerosis.The earliest morphologic arterial change in atherosclerosis is the juvenile (flat) fatty streak, commonly seen in children and adolescents. Raised fatty streaks (fatty plaque) represent the lesion intermediate between the juvenile (flat) fatty streak and the raised lesion of atherosclerosis. Many fatty streaks do not progress to fibrous plaques or complicated (ulcerative, thrombosed, hemorrhagic) atheromatous lesions. Although the progression from fatty streaks through fibrous plaques and complicated atheromatous lesions cannot be documented longitudinally in humans, such progression is presumed to occur.5,6 Long-range prevention of atherosclerosis should begin in childhood or adolescence.4View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780750674188000057Chronic Cardiac FailureNeil D. Gillespie, ... Allan D. Struthers, in Brocklehurst's Textbook of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology (Seventh Edition), 2010PATHOPHYSIOLOGYAs noted, the pathophysiology of heart failure is multifactorial, especially in older patients in whom hypertensive heart disease and valvular heart disease are more common. There may be structural abnormalities within the heart together with overcompensatory mechanisms in the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the peripheral vasculature. Although there are specific changes in the cardiovascular system with age, (see Chapter 14) such as increased calcification, increased myocardial fibrosis, and reduced ventricular compliance,32 most elderly patients with heart failure have additional pathology to explain their symptoms. In patients with heart failure due to ischemia, remodeling can result in alterations in the shape and morphology of the left ventricle with ultimate left ventricular dilatation and a large end-diastolic volume.33 In addition to changes in the structure of the left ventricle, many elderly patients have associated calcific degeneration of both the aortic and mitral valves, with functional and hemodynamically significant consequences.34 The cardiomyopathies35 are also a small but significant cause of heart failure in older patients, although the widely seen asymmetrical septal hypertrophy itself is not of great significance.36 In hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, the increase in collagen content of the ventricular wall and associated myocardial fibrosis may lead to diastolic filling abnormalities,37 which may contribute to the symptoms of heart failure, and represent a major pathophysiologic substrate for the phenomenon of heart failure with preserved systolic function (HPSF). In addition, loss of atrial contraction can result in significant hemodynamic deteriorations as atrial systole has an increased importance in the older patients when left ventricular wall stiffness is increased.38In a healthy person, cardiac output is influenced directly by stroke volume and heart rate. In the failing heart, stroke volume is maintained by increasing the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume, which is the basis of Starling’s law of the heart. However, eventually at very high left ventricular end-diastolic volumes there will be no subsequent compensatory increase in cardiac output. One of the aims of heart failure treatment is to minimize increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, so that cardiac output can be maintained and so that subsequent tissue oxygenation is adequate for perfusion of the vital organs.The autonomic nervous system and the neuroendocrine systems initially support the failing heart, but ultimately the compensatory mechanisms may themselves prove harmful. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can result in increased levels of angiotensin and aldosterone in the heart, kidney, brain, and vascular system, with undesirable consequences.39 Furthermore, the associated high levels of plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline (epinephrine and norepinephrine) are associated with a poor prognosis due to deleterious effects on myocardial function, autonomic balance, and peripheral vascular function.40Much of the fluid overload and edema in heart failure is a result of the effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the kidney, and reduced bradykinin may be associated with increased vasoconstriction. Changes in the morphology of skeletal muscle may explain the fatigability seen in heart failure patients over and above that expected with reduced tissue blood supply.41 Disruption of the microvasculature is also seen with impaired endothelial function.42 These changes are usually consequences of the disease process and not merely related to age, although in extremely old patients with mild symptoms of cardiac failure, true pathologic processes and age-related processes may be difficult to differentiate.Such age-related changes include a reduction of cardiac output on exercise, an increase in end-systolic volume, a decrease in ejection fraction with exercise, and a reduced heart rate with exercise.43 It is important to note, however, that heart failure is a disease with systemic effects; derangements of immune function cause a proinflammatory response that may in itself be cardiotoxic and contributes to the development of anemia; circulating cytokines may also help to drive the prominent skeletal myopathy that accompanies heart failure and is in fact the major cause of tiredness and breathlessness in heart failure patients. This skeletal myopathy in turn causes abnormalities of ergoreceptor function that drive further sympathetic nervous system activation. Disturbance of lung architecture and gas exchange are seen in the lungs of heart failure patients even in the absence of overt fluid overload—a further contributor to the symptoms of heart failure.Most of the established treatments for heart failure are in patients with systolic dysfunction. Even so, there are many elderly patients with normal systolic function who have symptoms and signs compatible with heart failure. Conversely, many elderly patients have these “diastolic abnormalities” on echocardiography but no symptoms of heart failure. The relative clinical significance of the diastolic abnormalities in these patients is unclear. They may go on to develop subsequent heart failure as a result of atrial fibrillation or systolic dysfunction, or may have intermittent episodes of mild cardiac decompensation possibly as a result of silent myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, echocardiographically determined measures of diastolic dysfunction are critically dependent on the degree of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Such variables include transmitral flow velocities (the E to A ratio), the isovolumic relaxation time.44 Further work is needed to establish the clinical usefulness of these measures and newer echocardiographic indices such as measures of longitudinal systolic function.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416062318100406Perioperative Hypertension: Preparing the Hypertensive Patient for Anesthesia for SurgeryPierre Foëx, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007ADMISSION BLOOD PRESSURE AND OUTCOMEIf it is accepted that hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular complications of anesthesia, is this the result of the presence of hypertensive heart disease or does it relate closely to the level of blood pressure at the time of admission for surgery? In 1979, Goldman and Caldera19 examined patients with arterial hypertension who were included in their risk index.12 No significant differences were found between patients who were hypertensive at the time of surgery and those who were normotensive, treated with diuretics, or hypertensive but relatively well controlled (blood pressure below 160/100 mmHg). The absence of difference may be ascribed to two factors: (1) the study did not have the statistical power to confirm or refute an association between hypertension and outcome, and (2) very few patients had blood pressures that could be classified as stage 3 hypertension. Indeed, only 5 of 196 patients had a diastolic blood pressure higher than 111 mmHg.19 Other studies20,21 also suffered a lack of statistical power. One study showed a clear association between hypertension and perioperative myocardial re-infarction.22 Hypertension has also been shown to play a role in the risk of complications after coronary artery surgery.23Two case-control studies24,25 have examined the relationship between hypertension and cardiac death within 30 days of surgery with close matching for age, sex, and operation. There was no difference in the admission blood pressure between the patients who died and the survivors.24 This was also true when both elective and emergency operations were considered, although there was a tendency for survivors to have a higher admission blood pressure.25 While the studies suggest that high admission blood pressure does not correlate with postoperative cardiac death, the limitation of the studies, which also applies to most recent studies of hypertension in surgical patients, is that very few patients had stage 3 hypertension; most had stage 1 or 2 hypertension. Only older studies included many patients with stage 3 hypertension. In such patients cardiovascular lability is greatly increased, and there is a high risk of myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmias if they are untreated.7Today, the absence of a clear association between admission blood pressure and cardiac outcome of anesthesia and surgery may reflect changes in standards of perioperative care of these patients, changes in perioperative drug therapies, changes in standards of monitoring, or improvement in the standard of care of the hypertensive patient in the community leading to fewer patients exhibiting the complications of renal dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, or other organ damage.Medical patients with stage 3 hypertension are at a significantly increased risk of target-organ damage that is not always apparent. Unsurprisingly, a recent guideline recommends echocardiography for the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy, and carotid Doppler sonography to detect carotid artery disease,26 as the presence of such target-organ damage increases the risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications.With the increase in blood pressure there is an increased incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities.27,28 In hypertensive patients, there is evidence of an association between quality of blood pressure control and the occurrence of silent postoperative myocardial ischemia (a marker for postoperative cardiovascular complications).29Most studies have not considered arterial pressure as a continuous variable, although it is well known that, in the long term, the risk of adverse outcome correlates with the severity of hypertension.30 However, when blood pressure was considered as a continuous variable in surgical patients, it became apparent that the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia increased with blood pressure: the odds ratio was 1.2 (CI=1.01-1.42) for each 10-mmHg increase in systolic pressure.31 This observation indicates that in surgical patients, as in medical patients, the risk of adverse outcome increases with the level of hypertension.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500635Cardiologic Investigation of the Hypertensive PatientRobert J.

The evolution of hypertensive heart disease from the state of hypertrophic changes (with generally well-preserved systolic contractility) is a complex process (see other chapters), with progressive change through to a phase of ventricular dilatation and systolic impairment. These patients tend to have unrecognized, untreated, or persistently uncontrolled hypertension, and the progression to systolic impairment of the heart is not often recognized short of acute presentation of pulmonary edema. The widely cited but poorly analyzed association of arterial hypertension to systolic left ventricular impairment suggests the presence of such a progressive change regardless of the definition or recognition of intervening coronary occlusion and ventricular infarction.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500490Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Health and DiseaseFereidoon Shahidi, in Omega-3 Oils, 2011Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular DiseaseCardiovascular disease is the common term for all diseases that affect the heart and the circulatory system, including ischemic heart disease, non-ischemic myocardial heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and valvular heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the western societies (de Lorgeril et al., 2002) and has been linked to the high fat intake, particularly saturated fat, common in western diets (Dolocek & Granditis, 1991). The hallmark of cardiovascular disease is cardiac dysfunction, which in most cases is caused by hypertension due to the narrowing of large arteries with atheromatous plaques, or the total occlusion of coronary arteries (thrombus) caused by atheromatous blockages leading to myocardial tissue necrosis. Both conditions reduce the heart's ability to pump blood and can result in either chronic or sudden heart failure.It is well known that regular consumption of fatty fish or fish oils containing n-3 long-chain PUFA lowers the rate of incidence and death from cardiovascular heart disease (Albert et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2002). The cardioprotective effects of marine oils were first postulated in the 1950s based on cross-cultural studies done on Greenland Inuits and Danish settlers of Greenland (Sinclair, 1956). These studies demonstrated that the Greenland Inuits had a significantly lower incidence of heart disease compared to the Danish settlers, despite their comparable fat intakes (40% of caloric intake) and a higher intake of dietary cholesterol. This anomaly was referred to as the ‘Eskimo Paradox’ (Bang et al., 1980). Epidemiological studies carried out in the 1970s suggested a strong correlation between the low incidence of coronary heart disease in Greenland Inuits and their high consumption of fish and marine mammals, both being rich in long chain n-3 fatty acids (Fischer & Weber, 1984). Other cross-cultural epidemiological studies among coastal Japanese and Alaskan populations lend further support to these findings, showing inverse relationships between long chain n-3 PUFA intake and cardiovascular disease (Hirai et al., 1989; Davidson et al., 1993).Although the biochemical basis for cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs remains unknown, it may be multifactorial and could collectively result in anti-arrhythmic, anti-atherogenic and decreased platelet reactivity/aggregation (anti-thrombotic). Investigations on the link between fish oils and cardiovascular disease in both animal and human models have concluded that this effect may be mediated by substrate competition between n-3 PUFA and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) for cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes that produce prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Competition between n-3 PUFA and AA could result in positive health benefits because a) n-3 fatty acids inhibit the production of AA through substrate competition for the DELTA-6 desaturase, b) long chain n-3 PUFA compete with AA for incorporation into the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids thereby reducing membrane AA levels (Siess et al., 1980), and c) eicosanoids produced from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-aggregatory effects, for example increasing the membrane EPA/AA ratio shifts eicosanoid production from the pro-aggregatory eicosanoids PGI2 and TXA2 towards the anti-aggregatory TXA3 in platelets (Coker & Parratt, 1985) and PGI3 in endothelial cells (Fischer & Weber, 1984). These actions would result in vasodilation and decreased platelet aggregation, both having anti-thrombotic effects.The potential anti-arrhythmic properties of n-3 PUFAs, such as ALA, EPA, and DHA, have been examined in animal models. In one such study, intravenous infusion of either fish oil or pure n-3 fatty acids in exercising dogs before an experimentally induced coronary artery obstruction reduced sudden cardiac death by preventing ventricular fibrillation (Billmann et al., 2000). The mechanisms of the antiarrhythmic effects of n-3 PUFAs have been further explored using spontaneously contracting cultured cardiac myocytes isolated from rats (Kang & Leaf, 2000). The cultured rat myocytes were induced to fibrillation using various toxic agents such as ouabain, beta-adrenergic agonists, and high Ca2+ concentrations added to the bathing medium. EPA and DHA added at low doses of 5–15 mu mol/L in the bathing medium inhibited the expected fibrillation when the toxic agents were added to the media (de Lorgeril et al., 1998). Interestingly, when the added EPA and DPA were removed from the culture media using delipidated bovine serum albumin, the cultured myocytes returned to fibrillation. Thus, n-3 PUFAs at low concentrations are able to modulate the activity of specific ion channels in myocardial sarcolemma.One of the most effective ways to protect the myocardium from ischemic/reperfusion injury is by inhibition of the transmembrane Na+/H+ antiport exchanger. This transmembrane antiport system maintains the myocardial cell's pH, but during ischemia this system paradoxically participates in cell necrosis. The importance of transmembrane Na+/H+ antiport exchanger in ischemic heart disease was shown in a clinical trial using a specific Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor caporide (Theroux et al., 2000). The inhibitor showed a potential benefit in reducing the risk of cardiac death as long as it was taken prior to the ischemic event (Amusquivar et al., 2000). It has recently been shown that EPA and DHA at concentrations of 25–100 mu M inhibited the Na÷/H+ antiport exchanger in isolated cardiomyocytes and, thus, could protect the myocardium from arrhythmias and cell death during ischemic events. This effect was limited to long chain n-3 fatty acids, as LA and ALA showed no significant effects on the Na+/H+ exchanger (Goel et al., 2002). Although the role of ALA in the prevention of arrhythmia caused by ischemia or during reperfusion remains unclear, the metabolic conversion of ALA to EPA is thought to mediate any of the cardioprotective effects of ALA, and at least one study using a canine model revealed cardioprotective effects with ALA (Chaudry et al., 1994).The “diet and reinfarction trial (DART)” was the earliest controlled trial that examined the effects of dietary intervention in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (Burr et al., 1989). The study included 2033 Welsh men who had recovered from an earlier heart attack and were allocated to one of two groups that received or did not receive advice on each of three dietary factors, namely reduced fat intake and an increased ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat, increased intake of fatty fish, and increased consumption of cereal fiber. The results of this landmark trial revealed that men receiving at least 2 fatty fish meals per week (200–400 g of fish meat or 1.5 g fish oil per day through supplement) had a 29% reduction in fatal heart attack risk, which was apparent after 4 months of intervention, when compared to the non-fish consuming groups, but there was no significant reduction in the incidence of non-fatal heart attacks. The results of this study strongly suggest that marine n-3 fatty acids have a specific antiarrhythmic effect rather than anti-atherogenic or anti-thombotic effects (Burr et al., 1989).The GISSI (1999), or Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienenza nell ‘Infarto Miocardio Prevenzione, study was initiated in 1993 and carried out over 3.5 years. This multicentered trial was conducted in Italy (172 centres) and included 11,324 patients who had suffered a heart attack less than 3 months prior to recruitment. Just as in the DART study (Thun et al., 1991), the GISSI Prevenzione study revealed that marine n-3 fatty acid intake conferred early and progressive risk reductions for cardiovascular disease.The Lyon Diet Heart Study (de Lorgeril et al., 1998) conducted in France was one of the earliest intervention trials (with 204 control subjects and 219 experimental subjects), making the hypothesis that a Mediterranean diet high in ALA could reduce the relative risk of cardiovascular events and/or death in previous heart attack victims. After 1 year of study, total cardiovascular events were reduced from 34.7% in the control group to 24.5% in the fish oil group and 28% in the mustard oil group (Narayanan et al., 2001).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781893997820500049Recommended publicationsInfo iconFEBS LettersJournalCell ReportsJournalEconomics & Human BiologyJournalJournal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: BiologyJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Sign in to download full-size imageFigure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and GynecologyJournalJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Sign in to download full-size imageFigure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and GynecologyJournalJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Figure 10.

Diffuse vasogenic edema is demonstrated (c) by CT 3 days later.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881HypertensionR.M. Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure.

Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalAmerican Journal of Obstetrics and GynecologyJournalJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Figure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension.

Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalJournal of Clinical NeuroscienceJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Figure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalJournal of Clinical NeuroscienceJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Figure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalJournal of Clinical NeuroscienceJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Francisco Antonio Helfenstein Fonseca, in Handbook of Nutrition, Diet and the Eye, 2014Blood Pressure and Retinal Vascular LesionsHypertensive retinopathy is characterized by generalized and focal arteriolar narrowing, flame- and blot-shaped retinal hemorrhages, arteriovenous nicking, optic disc swelling, and cotton-wool spots.24 In the ARIC study,21 hypertension was found to be related to retinopathy, arteriovenous nicking, and focal arteriolar narrowing. In another study with 711 nondiabetic subjects, microaneurysms were associated with hypertension and obesity, although the study did not find further evidence that microvascular retinopathy in patients without diabetes was a consequence of past hyperglycemia.43Some studies have shown greater expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the hyperinsulinemic state.44–47 In this scenario, endothelial dysfunction occurs with minor endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, diminishing glucose uptake and contributing to higher blood pressure levels. Insulin has an important vasodilatory action via production of nitric oxide; this effect is impaired in an insulin-resistant state, contributing to the association between hypertension and insulin resistance, which is reflected in changes to the retinal microvasculature.48View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124017177000629HypertensionCarol Yim Lui Cheung, Tien Yin Wong, in Retina (Fifth Edition), 2013Relationship with coronary heart diseaseThe presence of hypertensive retinopathy signs is associated with multiple markers of subclinical atherosclerotic diseases, including coronary artery calcification,55 aortic stiffness,56 left ventricular hypertrophy,57 and carotid intima-media thickness.58 There is also evidence that hypertensive retinopathy signs are predictive of clinical coronary artery disease events and congestive heart failure; however, the results of these studies show less consistent associations than with stroke.59–61 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were three times more likely to develop congestive heart failure than those without retinopathy, while controlling for the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.62Hypertensive retinopathy has also been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, stroke mortality, and coronary heart disease mortality.14,63,64 In one study, persons with moderate hypertensive retinopathy were more likely to die from coronary heart disease than persons without this sign, with an equivalent risk similar to that of diabetes.63 These data suggest that hypertensive retinopathy may convey additional prognostic information than other risk measures of CVD.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455707379000497HYPERTENSION 365.04Jeffrey R. Parnell MD, Lee M. Jampol MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008COURSE/PROGNOSISIn hypertensive retinopathy, acute elevations of blood pressure lead to retinal arterial vasoconstriction, an auto regulatory response. Persistent hypertension causes irreversible arteriolar narrowing. Chronically elevated pressure also causes sclerotic changes in the media of the arterial wall. Light-reflex changes observed on examination reflect the degree of sclerosis, which, in severe cases, may take on the appearance of burnished copper wire. Arteriolar occlusion may look like silver wire. At arteriovenous crossing sites, where the artery and vein share a common adventitial sheath, compression of the venule causes visible ‘nicking’ (Gunn's sign) of variable severity. Salus’ sign refers to the abnormal deflection of the venule as it crosses the arteriole at an increasingly obtuse angle or even a right angle. Chronic hypertension may also cause occasional retinal microaneurysms. Arterial macroaneurysms are also seen in association with chronic hypertensive retinopathy. Sclerotic hypertensive vascular changes may contribute to branch or central vein occlusion and branch or central retinal artery occlusions.Acute, malignant, or accelerated hypertension leads to leakage of the retinal arterioles, with decompensation of the inner blood-retina barrier. This may be manifested as extravasation of blood and lipoprotein into the retina in the form of superficial hemorrhages, cotton wool spots (infarcts), hard exudates (lipid), and capillary occlusions. Malignant hypertension also can cause hypertensive choroidopathy and hypertensive optic nerve changes. In hypertensive choroidopathy, fibrinoid changes in the choriocapillaris result in focal nonperfusion that leads to ischemia of the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Acute Elschnig's spots are white or yellow patches of ischemic retinal pigment epithelium overlying occluded choriocapillaris. Acute exudation through the injured retinal pigment epithelium layer can lead to neurosensory detachments. These spots ‘heal’ and become hyperpigmented over time. Linear hyperpigmentation overlying choroidal arteries is called Seigrist's streaks and represents hyperplastic retinal pigment epithelium. Elschnig's spots, after healing, are also hyperpigmented.Disk edema is seen with severe hypertension. This swelling of the nerve head may be secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy with raised intracranial pressure, local ischemia, or vascular (venous) congestion within the nerve. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve atrophy can be seen.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477501675Neural (Sensory) RetinaMyron Yanoff MD, Joseph W. Sassani MD MHA, in Ocular Pathology (Eighth Edition), 2020Hypertensive and Arteriolosclerotic Retinopathy1I.Hypertensive retinopathy (Fig. 11.14)A.Grade I: a generalized narrowing of the arteriolesB.Grade II: grade I changes plus focal arteriolar spasmsC.Grade III: grade II changes plus hemorrhages and exudates1.Flame-shaped (splinter) hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.12–11.14; see also Fig. 15.19) are characteristic and present in the nerve fiber layer.2.Dot-and-blot hemorrhages (see Figs. 11.13 and 15.19) may be seen in the inner nuclear layer with spreading to the outer plexiform layer.3.Cotton-wool spots (see Figs. 11.11 and 11.14; see earlier in this chapter) are characteristic.Cotton-wool spots may be seen in many conditions, such as collagen diseases, CRVO, blood dyscrasias, AIDS, and multiple myeloma.4.Hard (waxy) exudates may be seen; these are lipophilic exudates located in the outer plexiform layer (see Figs. 11.14, 15.14, and 15.17).When the exudates are numerous in the macula and lie in the obliquely oriented and radially arranged fiber layer of Henle, they appear as a macular star.D.Grade IV: all the changes of grade III plus optic disc edema.Necrosis, thinning, clumping, and proliferation of the RPE may occur as a result of obliterative changes in the choriocapillaris in malignant hypertension. Four types of fundus lesions associated with choroidal vascular changes have been recognized clinically: (1) pale yellow or red patches bordered to a varying extent by pigment deposits; (2) black, isolated spots of pigment with a surrounding yellow or red halo caused by complete obstruction of terminal choroidal arterioles and choriocapillaris by fibrin thrombi (Elschnig's spots; see Fig. 11.14D); (3) linear chains of pigment flecks along the course of a yellow-white sclerosed choroidal vessel (Siegrist's spots); and (4) yellow or red patches of chorioretinal atrophy.II.Arteriolosclerotic retinopathy (Fig. 11.15)A.Grade I: an increase in the arteriolar light reflex.Subintimal hyalin deposition and a thickened media and adventitia cause the normally transparent arteriolar wall to become semiopaque, producing an increased light reflex.B.Grade II: grade I changes plus arteriolovenular crossing defects.The semiopaque wall of the arteriolosclerotic arteriole, which shares a common adventitia with the venule where they cross, obscures the view of the underlying venule. This results in the clinically seen arteriolovenular crossing defects, or “nicking.”C.Grade III: grade II changes plus “copper-wire” arterioles.The arteriolar wall becomes sufficiently opaque so that the blood column can be seen only by looking perpendicularly through the surface of the wall (i.e., looking through the thinnest area). The arteriole has a burnished or copper appearance due to reflection of light from the thickened and partially opacified wall.D.Grade IV: grade II changes plus “silver-wire” arterioles.The wall becomes totally opaque so that the blood column in the lumen cannot be seen. The light is reflected completely from the surface of the thickened vessel, giving a white or silver appearance. The lumen of the arteriole may or may not be patent. Patency can best be determined by fluorescein angiography.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323547550000115Retinal Vasculature: Structure and PathologiesA. Das, J. Byrd, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Animal modelsAll the hypertensive retinopathy changes in humans have been reproduced in animal models. Earlier studies using renal artery clamping (Goldblatt) in dogs and monkeys have produced bilateral retinal hemorrhages, thickened arterial intima and hyperplasia of muscle, cotton-wool spots, and retinal edema. Similar changes have been reported in hypertensive rats (by either constriction of renal artery or administering corticosteroids and salt). In studies with glass microspheres in pigs, obstruction of arteries for only a few hours was needed to produce cotton-wool spots. It is important to note that the arteriolar narrowing in hypertension is reversible in rats, dogs, and monkeys.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567047092BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION 362.36Thomas Hwang MD, Michael Klein MD, in Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy (Sixth Edition), 2008Differential diagnosisDiabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy can have many of the characteristics of branch retinal vein occlusion, including intraretinal hemorrhages, nerve fiber layer infarcts, macular edema, lipid exudation and retinal neovascularization. Branch retinal vein occlusions differ from those conditions in their localization along a retinal vein territory.Retinal vasculitides with venous involvement, such as sarcoidosis and Eales disease, may have some features of vein occlusion, such as venous sheathing and tortunosity. They may also have associated branch retinal vein occlusions. These underlying conditions should be considered, especially when branch retinal vein occlusion occurs in atypical locations, i.e. away from arteriovenous crossings.Patients with retinal macroaneurysms may present with retinal hemorrhages and macular edema that appear to follow a vascular territory. This condition is also associated with hypertension. Fluorescein angiography may be helpful in identifying macroaneurysms. Branch retinal vein occlusion may occur concurrently as a result of a macroaneurysm.Sclerotic arterioles of chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can be mistaken for old branch artery occlusion. Associated telangiectatic changes of the vessels are usually not present with arterial occlusion.The telangiectatic-appearing vessels of a chronic branch retinal vein occlusion can mimic the appearance of idiopathic parafoveal retinal telangiectasis and the two can be difficult to differentiate. While many cases can be distinguished based on location, history and longitudinal follow-up may be necessary in others.Sometimes the same telangiectatic-appearing vessels as appear in BRVO are mistaken for intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) of diabetic retinopathy. Although the two conditions both cause dilated, tortuous intraretinal capillaries, IRMA in diabetic retinopathy is usually not concentrated in a quadrant along a vascular territory.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416024477503352Medical RetinaJennifer E. Thorne, Douglas A. Jabs, in Retina (Fourth Edition), 2006Ocular manifestationsThe most characteristic ocular findings are hypertensive retinopathy and Takayasu's retinopathy. In a series of 78 patients with Takayasu's arteritis, 30.8% of patients had hypertensive retinopathy and 13.5% had Takayasu's retinopathy.281 Takayasu's retinopathy may be categorized into four stages: (1) stage 1 is dilation of small vessels; (2) stage 2 is capillary microaneurysm formation; (3) stage 3 is retinal arteriovenous anastomoses; and (4) stage 4 is arteriovenous anastomoses with other ocular complications.281,282 The arteriovenous anastomoses are generally seen around the disc and in the midperiphery, and they are thought to be due to ocular ischemia from narrowing of the common carotid and vertebral arteries. The retinal changes can be best demonstrated by fluorescein angiography. More severe ischemia may result in peripheral retinal nonperfusion, neovascularization, and vitreous hemorrhage.282View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323025980500811The Natural History of Untreated HypertensionWilliam J. Elliott, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013RetinopathyAlthough not widely appreciated by physicians today, hypertensive retinopathy played a very important role in the assessment of target organ damage in the era before antihypertensive drugs were available. Papilledema, the hallmark of “malignant hypertension,” and the lower grades of K-W-B retinopathy encompassed one early classification scheme for hypertension that had important prognostic implications. The natural history of hypertension complicated by Grade IV funduscopic changes was so poor that the condition was named “malignant hypertension,” because few cancers were associated with a worse short-term mortality rate. Hypertensive retinopathy seldom led to blindness, but the high risk of cardiovascular events justified its use in early systems to predict outcomes, including death. The natural history of high-Grade hypertensive retinopathy has not been carefully elucidated, but papilledema generally resolves within a few days after effective antihypertensive therapy is begun. Several population-based studies have shown the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy to range between 5% and 15%, depending on the site, age of patients, and how many diabetics are in the sample.58 The incidence of both hypertensive retinopathy and progression of this disease through its usual stages have both been much reduced since the advent of antihypertensive therapy.58View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000132Recommended publicationsInfo iconOphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of OphthalmologyJournalAmerican Journal of HypertensionJournalAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology Case ReportsJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

See Box 35-1 for factors that suggest the presence of secondary hypertension, and Table 35-2 for etiologies and screening techniques. Hypertension due to secondary causes is less likely to be seen in elderly individuals. Therefore, when assessing accelerated or poorly controlled blood pressures, one should always evaluate for etiologies of poorly controlled (resistant) essential hypertension: poor compliance, inadequate drug prescribing, medications that raise blood pressures (decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, etc.), spuriously elevated blood pressures, increased volume expansion, and excessive sodium and/or alcohol intake.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039307500432A Short History of the Study of HypertensionD. Gareth Beevers, J. Ian S. Robertson, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SECONDARY HYPERTENSIONSecondary hypertension is defined as raised blood pressure resulting from a recognizable and often potentially correctable cause, and is thus to be distinguished from the much more prevalent primary (“essential”) hypertension. In unselected populations of hypertensive subjects, no more than 1% to 5% of cases are secondary, although a much higher proportion of a given disease may be seen in centers having a particular interest in that condition.20,54–56The principal forms of secondary hypertension are listed in Box 1-1. They are evidently numerous and diverse. These various conditions were identified at irregular intervals throughout the 20th century and additions continue to be made.Despite their comparative rarity, secondary forms of hypertension have attracted much interest. First, many such syndromes, particularly the rare monogenic forms of hypertension, are readily responsive to correction of the underlying cause. Second, a study of the mechanisms whereby the blood pressure is raised in these disorders facilitates insights into the pathophysiology of essential hypertension; this is a compelling impetus for the study of even very rare forms of secondary hypertension, many of which involve primary excess reabsorption of sodium by the renal tubules.Two interesting aspects of secondary hypertension were noted by Pickering in 1955.27 The first of these was that virtually every such condition can enter the malignant phase, and that such transition was more likely with a rapid rise of blood pressure. The concept can now be broadened, because it is seen to apply not only to the malignant phase but also to all of the vascular complications of hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, with the proviso that with aortic coarctation the renal vasculature is protected. Such indiscriminate effects of high blood pressure are modified by concomitant pathophysiology in various syndromes. Thus, considerable evidence has suggested that elevation of angiotensin II can have especially adverse effects on the heart, arteries, and kidney.37 A further proposal is that aldosterone can induce myocardial extracellular matrix and collagen deposition, although not all studies have supported the notion.39–43 An excess of circulating catecholamines, as with pheochromocytoma, can cause focal myocardial lesions. In Cushing's syndrome, increased cortisol may promote myocardial hypertrophy independently of blood pressure.The second of Pickering's 1955 observations27 was that blood pressure may remain raised in a proportion of cases of secondary hypertension even after the primary cause has been removed or corrected, although the pressure may be more readily controlled with drugs. Such persistent hypertension is probably largely a consequence of hypertension-induced changes, including structural thickening of the walls of resistance arteries, and especially to alterations of the arteries of the kidney. Renal functional impairment has been consistently noted as presaging a less satisfactory fall in blood pressure after correction of the causal abnormality.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500040Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.K Fulminant Hepatic FailureIntracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral edema frequently complicates the course of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The devastating effects of cerebral edema contribute to the high mortality of this condition, with cerebral edema noted in 50–80% of cases at autopsy. Although the progressive obtundation of fulminant hepatic failure may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy, important differences exist. The rapid demise associated with fulminant hepatic failure results from a combination of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Fig. 10), whereas edema is not seen in cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema formation in fulminant hepatic failure has been attributed to the detrimental effects of ammonia. Due to an incomplete urea cycle in the brain, astrocytes detoxify ammonia to glutamine. Excessive production of glutamine leads to excitotoxic neuronal damage and astrocytic swelling, although osmotic compensation occurs in chronic liver disease. This cytotoxic process is aggravated by an influx of water resulting from a combination of augmented cerebral blood flow and disturbed autoregulation. Additional toxic injury is incurred by circulating endotoxins and cytokines, with excessive production of nitric oxide. The necrotic liver releases vasoactive substances producing dramatic cardiovascular instability. These fluctuations in cardiovascular function can complicate surgical transplantation, but autonomic stability is restored following removal of the diseased liver.Figure 10.

Mortensen, in Pathobiology of Human Disease, 2014Treatment of HypertensionFor secondary hypertension, the treatment is often correction of the abnormality often by surgical intervention. So renal artery stenosis could be corrected by increasing blood flow to the kidney. For hyperaldosteronism, secreting adrenal adenomas can be removed surgically, and if bilateral, the effects of excess aldosterone can be treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or the more specific eplerenone. These drugs have also been shown to have beneficial effects in heart failure apparently due to their antialdosterone activity but divorced from the direct diuretic action.The major pharmacological targets for treatment of primary hypertension are to attack renal sodium handling and hormonal and neural pathways. The first-line therapy is a diuretic to increase sodium loss. The primary drugs are hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. These are mild diuretics that act to inhibit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule. Their major side effect is hypokalemia, mostly due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal nephron and hence increased potassium excretion. Other diuretics can be potassium sparing. These include the aldosterone antagonists and also amiloride or triamterene that directly affect the distal sodium channel.If control is inadequate on a diuretic, another drug is added typically, one that targets the renin–angiotensin system. Most used are ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an AT1 receptor blocker such as losartan. Because they attack different parts of the enzyme cascade, their effects can be slightly different although the clinical response is very similar. ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II; so they decrease stimulation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. Since ACE also is responsible for bradykinin degradation, the bradykinin levels can increase and possibly through arachidonic acid metabolites or nitric oxide may stimulate a dry cough, which is a side effect in about 20% of patients.AT1 blockers on the other hand will have the effect of increasing angiotensin II levels through inhibition of negative feedback that would increase the activation of AT2 receptors. It may be this difference that leads to efficacy in other diseases such as experimental systems of Marfan’s syndrome and its resulting aortic aneurysm. Because it does not affect bradykinin levels, these drugs may have less side effect of cough although it has been reported and calls into question the presumed mechanism of cough.Both ACE inhibitors and AT1 blockers have been shown to decrease cardiac mortality and to decrease end-organ damage in hypertension. These positive effects are due not only to the antihypertensive effect but also to the direct effects of lowering stimulation by angiotensin II.Another common antihypertensive is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Although beta-blockers have vascular effects, the long-term antihypertensive effect likely involves changes in the beta-adrenergic renal stimulation. The use of these drugs is often limited by the side effects, which can include worsening asthma that can at least partially be addressed by specific beta1 agonists and problems with chronic fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or impotence. The use of beta-blockers alone is also contraindicated in pheochromocytoma because loss of the vasodilatory response with beta-blockade can actually lead to increased BP. Alpha1 adrenergic blockers such as prazosin reduce peripheral vascular resistance.Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, or diltiazem decrease vascular resistance by inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. The short-acting dihydropyridines such as nifedipine may cause reflex sympathetic activation and it can be hard to obtain the correct dosage with the danger of hypotension. Because of the negative cardiac effects, diltiazem and verapamil are contraindicated in heart failure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567055039Hypertension Due to Central Nervous System DysfunctionJ. David Spence, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007PROGNOSISThe prognosis of hypertension secondary to lesions of the central nervous system depends on how high the pressure goes, how well and how quickly it is controlled, and in part on the premorbid state of the vasculature. Patients who previously had low blood pressure will be at greater risk from a sudden severe rise in pressure because they will not have adaptive hypertrophy of their resistance vessels, and they will therefore be more likely to sustain a brain hemorrhage or hypertensive encephalopathy. In the longer term, the severe hypertension due to loss of reflex blood pressure control generally abates over several weeks with acute lesions such as stroke or carotid dissection. Surgical removal of the brainstem compression generally resolves the problem within days. The prognosis in epileptic cases depends on control of the epilepsy, and in this regard it is worth considering surgical treatment of the epilepsy if there is an accessible lesion, as surgical treatment of epilepsy is much more effective than medical therapy in resistant cases.36,37 Hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy can usually be managed, and because it occurs during a planned procedure, the management is usually successful.The principal exception is the syndrome of hypertension during bladder distension due to cervical cord transaction, which may continue for years.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500787HeadacheHans-Christoph Diener, ... David W. Dodick, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2010DefinitionHeadache attributed to intracranial hypertension secondary to hydrocephalus is defined in the International Headache Society's (IHS) classification of headache disorders (2004) with the following diagnostic criteria. The headache has to develop in close temporal relation to increased CSF pressure and to be resolved within 72 h of normalization of CSF pressure. Furthermore the headache should accomplish at least two of the following criteria:•diffuse pain•worse in the morning•worse with Valsalva-like maneuvers•accompanied by vomiting•associated with papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, altered level of consciousness, gait instability, and/or increased head circumference (in children <5 years old).“High-pressure hydrocephalus” is identified by the following criteria:•ventricular enlargement on neuroimaging•intracranial pressure >200 mmH2O in the non-obese or >250 mmH2O in the obese•no other intracranial disorder causing increased CSF pressure.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0072975210970504Cushing's Syndrome and Human Glucocorticoid HypertensionFernando Elijovich, Cheryl L. Laffer, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007Circadian rhythm of blood pressureOut of several forms of secondary hypertension in which the normal circadian rhythm of blood pressure is attenuated, abolished, or reversed, Cushing's syndrome is the one in which this abnormality (lack of nocturnal blood pressure “dip”) is most consistently observed, even in subjects without hypertension. The circadian rhythm of heart rate is preserved, indicating that the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts specific control of blood pressure (not heart rate) variability. Nocturnal dipping is always absent in Cushing's syndrome of long duration, suggesting an interaction between hypertension itself and hypercortisolism in determining loss of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Glucocorticoid treatment of collagen vascular disorders or renal disease reduces nocturnal dipping as much as endogenous Cushing's syndrome, whereas this is not so in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat,5 indicating that the effect is species-specific. Nocturnal dipping is more commonly normalized by surgical cure of adrenal than of pituitary Cushing's,6 and is restored to normal by cyproheptadine (inhibition of ACTH release7), suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on blood pressure variability is exerted in the central nervous system.Lack of nocturnal dipping of blood pressure is a known risk factor for exaggerated hypertensive target-organ damage, and antihypertensive drugs of several families do not correct it in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Therefore, the need to quickly address definitive therapy of Cushing's syndrome cannot be overemphasized.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323039611500726Renovascular Hypertension: Pathophysiology and Evaluation of Renal FunctionSabas I. Gomez, ... J. Carlos Romero, in Comprehensive Hypertension, 2007SUMMARYRenovascular hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension, that is, an underlying disease is leading to the cause of elevated BP. The renal vascular (renovascular) alteration is a narrowing of the artery(s) to one or both kidneys. This reduction of blood flow leads to the affected kidney or kidneys to mistakenly respond as if the BP is low. The primary mechanistic response to this stimulus is to secrete hormones that increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing vasoconstriction and, secondarily, to signal the body to retain salt and water, which causes an increase in BP. The ensuing cascade of events involves many pathogenic mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress, and varies depending on the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney. We have developed 3D imaging techniques of the kidney that allow for quantification and assessment of kidney function, thus making early detection and evaluation of the disease possible.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032303961150012XMicroneurographyAbu S.M. Shamsuzzaman, Virend K. Somers, in Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, 2003HypertensionIncreased sympathetic activity in both primary and secondary hypertension may be implicated in the etiology of hypertension, given the potent vasoconstrictor and pressor effects of increases in MSNA. Hypertensive patients have shown elevated MSNA at rest and in response to the cold pressor test, LBNP, apnea, hypoxia, and mental stress. Genetic factors in normotensive offspring of hypertensive patients may influence baseline MSNA and responses to mental stress. Earlier studies in essential and borderline hypertensive patients have shown not only an increase in baseline MSNA and responses to stressors but also a blunted baroreflex inhibition of MSNA compared to healthy subjects.Patients with accelerated hypertension have been shown to also have high MSNA compared to subjects with benign hypertension. Matching age and adiposity between normal and borderline hypertensive groups also supports the concept of augmented MSNA in hypertension. Nevertheless, the association between heightened MSNA and hypertension remains controversial, with a number of studies noting no increased MSNA in hypertensive subjects.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122268709002252AldosteronePer Hellman, ... Tobias Åkerström, in Vitamins and Hormones, 20192 BackgroundPrimary aldosteronism is a potentially curable variant of secondary hypertension but has been somewhat difficult to diagnose. The cause for the secondary hypertension is excess secretion of aldosterone from either an adenoma (Conn adenoma) from one adrenal gland or hyperplasia from usually both adrenal glands. Aldosterone causes excretion of potassium into the urine and uptake of sodium together with water, resulting in hypokalemia, increased blood volume and hypertension, but not hypernatremia due to concomitant dilution of also reabsorbed water. Since secondary aldosteronism is very common, it is not sufficient to use only plasma measurements of aldosterone as diagnosis. Plasma renin is compensatory low in PA, and the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is now used as the standard method in suspicion of PA. Also, the first decades after identification of the disease it was strictly associated to hypokalemia, but more recent studies have proven that approximately less than a third of patients have hypokalemia, the remainder being normokalemic. This has increased the diagnostic rate of found PA, which was initially low. Indeed, over the last 15 years, the ARR has been applied also in normokalemia, resulting in a 5- to 15-fold increase in PA diagnosis. Approximately 30% of PA is due to an adenoma, the rest of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The diagnosis of an adenoma will lead to a possibility of cure of hypertension, associated with normalization of aldosterone excess and normokalemia (Miller et al., 2018). BAH may also be surgically cured if associated with asymmetrical secretion of aldosterone, otherwise it should be treated with proper medication—mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The last decade has been a breakthrough in the genetic understanding of underlying derangements of the Conn adenoma. In 2011 the KCNJ5 gene was identified as mutated, causing a dysfunctional GIRK4 ion channel leading to depolarization of the adrenocortical cell and increased aldosterone release (Choi et al., 2011). A mutated KCNJ5 is present in approximately 47% of adenomas (Akerstrom et al., 2012), with higher rates in Japan and China (Lenzini et al., 2015). Further research identified additional genes; ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D and CTNNB1 as when mutated causing the same pathophysiological derangement (Azizan et al., 2013; Beuschlein et al., 2013; Scholl et al., 2013). Thus, most common cause for PA is BAH, which has a tendency to increase in prevalence with age.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083672918300797Recommended publicationsInfo iconHeliyonJournalTopics in Companion Animal MedicineJournalChronic Renal Disease (Second Edition)Book • 2020The Veterinary JournalJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Bar, in Primer on Cerebrovascular Diseases (Second Edition), 2017AbstractHypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by acute hypertension leading to a clinical syndrome with characteristic radiological findings. The clinical findings include encephalopathy, seizures, headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits. It is now commonly recognized that hypertensive encephalopathy represents one of the etiologies of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). It is critical to recognize this syndrome early since this allows for rapid treatment and a good overall prognosis. The underlying pathophysiology leading to PRES is incompletely understood. Fortunately, the treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is relatively straightforward and most patients make a complete recovery.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128030585001399Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Sixth Edition), 2016Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see above), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).11 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the 2nd to 4th decades of life.It is estimated that about 1% of patients with hypertension will, at some point, develop a hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic BP of 180 mmHg or greater or a diastolic BP of 110 mmHg or greater). Hypertensive crisis can be further classified as a hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency depending on end-organ involvement including cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic injury (i.e., hypertensive encephalopathy). Hypertensive emergencies represent approximately 25% of hypertensive crises and require immediate BP reduction (not necessarily to normal levels) to prevent or limit target organ damage.48,49Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy.Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerulonephritis, renovascular disease, renal infarction,50 renal failure51) is the most common cause (Box 38-1) of hypertensive encephalopathy.11 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include autoimmune disorders,22 endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma28, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renin-secreting tumors), porphyria,52 thermal injury,53 head injuries and central nervous system (CNS) trauma, autonomic hyperactivity (Guillain–Barré syndrome),54 scorpion envenomation,55 cocaine or amphetamine abuse,56 interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tyramine), triple-H therapy for symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm57 and use of over-the-counter stimulants58 (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323295444000384Hypertensive EncephalopathyCatherine Lamy, Jean-Louis Mas, in Stroke (Fifth Edition), 2011CausesHypertensive encephalopathy occurs as a result of a sudden, sustained rise in blood pressure, from any cause, sufficient to exceed the upper limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. As would be predicted from the physiology of autoregulation (see earlier discussion), the degree of hypertension required to precipitate encephalopathy depends on the premorbid pressure. Previously normotensive individuals can show signs of encephalopathy at blood pressures as low as 160 mm Hg systolic, 100 mm Hg diastolic (160/100 mm Hg).12 The condition may occur at any age but is most common in the second to fourth decades of life.Antihypertensive treatment has markedly reduced the incidence of hypertensive encephalopathy in individuals with known hypertension. However, abrupt elevations of blood pressure (characteristically above 220/110 mm Hg) in patients with chronic hypertension who are receiving either no treatment or insufficient treatment or in patients whose treatment has been discontinued may cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Acute or chronic renal disease (acute glomerular nephropathy, renal artery stenosis, renal infarction, renal failure) is one of the most common causes of hypertensive encephalopathy.12 Whether the greater tendency toward development of hypertensive encephalopathy in patients with renal hypertension than in those with essential hypertension is related to increased circulating permeability factors or to endothelial damage remains to be determined.Eclampsia is usually considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy on the basis of similarities in clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features.17,44,45 The fluid accumulation often observed during pregnancy may accentuate the tendency for brain edema to develop. However, there is not always a good correlation between symptoms and signs of eclampsia and level of blood pressure.46 Several findings suggest that vascular endothelial damage may play a role in preeclampsia/eclampsia.46,47 Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation that is associated with increased systemic vascular resistance, enhanced platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation system, and endothelial cell dysfunction.48 The increase in peripheral resistance and blood pressure may be mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, as suggested by a study that used intraneural recordings of sympathetic nerve activity in skeletal muscle nerve fascicles of women with preeclampsia.49 The precise mechanism underlying the increased sympathetic nerve activity remains, however, to be determined. Endothelial damage is thought to be due to the secretion of trophoblastic cytotoxic factors originating from a poorly perfused fetoplacental unit. Generalized endothelial dysfunction may lead to (1) increased sensitivity to normally circulating pressor agents and impaired synthesis of vasoactive compounds, which may result in vasospasm and reduced organ perfusion, (2) platelet activation with transitory platelet-rich microvascular occlusion, (3) activation of the coagulation cascade, and (4) loss of fluid from the intravascular compartment.50Other clinical situations associated with hypertensive encephalopathy include vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa); endocrine disorders (pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism); porphyria; thermal injury; scorpion envenomation; cocaine or amphetamine abuse; and use of over-the-counter stimulants (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, caffeine).5,6,12,51 Hypertensive encephalopathy may also occur in previously normotensive patients after bilateral carotid endarterectomy, in association with carotid baroreceptor failure syndrome.52Hinchey and colleagues4 reported on 15 patients with a reversible syndrome of headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual loss, associated with posterior white matter changes on neuroimaging, that they termed reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. Of the 15 patients, 7 were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) after transplantation or as treatment for aplastic anemia, 1 was receiving interferon-alpha for melanoma, 3 had eclampsia, and 4 had hypertensive encephalopathy. Most of the patients had an abrupt increase in blood pressure, but 3 of 15 were normotensive. Because MRI has shown that lesions can occur in both gray and white matter, a new name, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), was coined.6,25,51 This clinicoradiologic syndrome has been subsequently described in children53 and has been recognized in a growing number of medical conditions, including disorders such as myeloproliferative disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome; treatment with erythropoietin, granulocyte-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulin, interleukin, immunosuppressant agents such as cisplatin, cytarabine, and vincristine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gemcitabine, and tiazofurin; antiangiogenic therapies; blood transfusion; and exposure to contrast media.5,6,51 Although most of the patients had some degree of hypertension, blood pressure levels were usually lower than those typically encountered with pure hypertensive encephalopathy.Failure of the autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vessels, itself resulting from various mechanisms, including hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, may represent a common pathophysiologic mechanism leading to this syndrome. Immunosuppressive drugs can damage the blood-brain barrier by various means: direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium, endothelial dysfunction secondary to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition, vasoconstriction caused by release of endothelin, and increases in thromboxane and prostacyclin causing microthrombi.4,51 The additional role of seizures has been suggested.4,51,54 Seizures can result in elevations of blood pressure, regional hyperperfusion breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and vasogenic edema. Infection, shock, or severe metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic dysfunction) may also be contributing factors.4,6,51 Hypertension may therefore be the sole cause leading to PRES or may act as a contributing factor.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416054788100375Hypertensive EmergenciesCatherine L. Kelleher, Stuart L. Linas, in Clinical Critical Care Medicine, 2006Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy may occur with or without malignant hypertension. In hypertensive encephalopathy, the mean arterial pressure exceeds the limits of autoregulation and brain edema develops from extravasation of plasma proteins (see Fig. 32.2). Left untreated, coma and death may follow. The challenge of hypertensive encephalopathy is appropriate lowering of BP in the setting of CNS ischemia and edema. The hallmark of hypertensive encephalopathy is clinical improvement within 12 to 24 hours of adequate BP reduction. The mean arterial pressure should be reduced by no more than 15% over 2 to 3 hours. Neurologic complications have been reported from reductions in MAP of 40% or more. If an acute decline in mental status occurs with treatment, the BP should be allowed to increase until neurologic symptoms resolve. It should then be reduced over several days to allow restoration of autoregulation.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323028448500378Hypertensive EmergenciesFrank M. van der Sande, ... Karel M. Leunissen, in Critical Care Nephrology (Second Edition), 2009HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHYHypertensive encephalopathy is defined as decreased alertness, impaired cognitive function, delirium, and in some cases, generalized seizures or cortical blindness, unexplained by other disease and reversible with blood pressure lowering.58 The diagnosis should be questioned when the neurological symptoms do not abate with antihypertensive treatment. Patients with hypertensive encephalopathy often present with headache, visual disturbances, convulsions, and sometimes even overt coma, preceded by an abrupt increase in blood pressure. Hypertensive encephalopathy may occur in the absence of retinal changes86 and does not always coincide with the other clinical features of malignant hypertension.45,64 Possible etiological factors include eclampsia, pheochromocytoma, acute withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, and renovascular disease.13 Recently, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in its pathogenesis.87 Primary cerebral stroke, which also may be followed by severe increases in blood pressure,88 can be difficult to distinguish clinically from hypertensive encephalopathy. An important point, however, is that primary cerebral stroke is common and hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon.Hypertensive encephalopathy probably results from loss of cerebral autoregulation secondary to a severe rise in blood pressure (“breakthrough theory”), leading to cerebral hyperperfusion and focal cerebral edema.89 An intense vasoconstriction in response to an acute blood pressure rise also has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism (“overregulation theory”).13,64 Especially patients with previously normal blood pressure levels, such as occurs in eclampsia or acute renal failure, are at risk for the development of this intense vasoconstriction condition.86,90 In these patients, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur at relatively low blood pressure levels (as low as 100 mm Hg diastolic).91 In patients with hypertensive encephalopathy, the computed tomography (CT) scan may appear completely normal or display only signs of cerebral edema. Parallel to the clinical presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior leukoencephalopathy can be seen on a MRI scan. The latter are mostly bilateral abnormalities of the parieto-occipital white matter regions of cerebrum, cerebellum, or cerebral cord.92 These abnormalities probably are caused by perivascular edema of areas with an intensive sympathetic innervation of the vessels.93 These abnormalities, which are reversible when appropriately treated, constitute the well-characterized posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PLS).94 The treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is covered later on.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416042525501866Assessment of Hypertensive Target Organ DamageJoseph L. Izzo, ... James J. Reidy, in Hypertension: A Companion to Braunwald’s Heart Disease (Second Edition), 2013Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is now uncommon, probably because of greater awareness of hypertension, more widespread use of effective antihypertensive combinations, and better BP control.56 Encephalopathy occurs when there is a sudden increase in BP to very high levels, often mean arterial pressure >150 mm Hg in adults but at much lower levels in children. As BP increases, cerebrovascular constriction (part of normal cerebral autoregulation) gives way to vascular collapse, with increased vascular permeability, acute fibrinoid change of the vessel walls, brain edema, thrombosis, and microinfarcts. Eclampsia is considered a special case of hypertensive encephalopathy. Treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may result in complete neurologic recovery; subsequent control of BP avoids recurrence.Assessment of hypertensive encephalopathy includes a careful history that may reveal headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms, or seizures. Visual symptoms suggest parietooccipital brain involvement. The cardinal physical finding is papilledema. Brain swelling and other focal perfusion defects can be detected by brain CT or MRI. More discussion of diagnosis and therapy of this condition is found in Chapter 46.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437727661000156Cerebral EdemaDavid S. Liebeskind, in Encyclopedia of the Human Brain, 2002II.F Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency characterized by exceedingly elevated blood pressures with the subsequent development of focal cerebral edema. This potentially reversible condition presents with rapidly progressive neurological signs, headache, seizures, altered mental status, and visual disturbances. The clinical and neuroradiologic presentation of hypertensive encephalopathy shares similarity with the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a clinical entity that encompasses multiple disorders with a common predisposition for the development of focal cerebral edema. The pathogenesis of edema formation is controversial but is thought to involve elevated hydrostatic forces due to excessive blood pressure, with lesser degrees of involvement attributed to vasogenic edema and secondary ischemic components. The contributions of autoregulatory dysfunction and BBB leakage compared to hydrostatic causes of plasma extravasation continue to be controversial. The rate of blood pressure elevation is a critical factor, because hypertensive encephalopathy usually develops during acute exacerbations of hypertension. Chronic hypertension has induced adaptive modifications of cerebral resistance vessels, thereby minimizing the harmful effects of elevated hydrostatic forces. Early recognition and treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy may reverse cerebral edema, preventing permanent damage to the BBB, and ischemia, although severe cases may be fatal.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122272102000881Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular DiseaseJustin A. Zivin, in Goldman's Cecil Medicine (Twenty Fourth Edition), 2012DefinitionHypertensive encephalopathy is usually defined as malignant hypertension associated with central nervous system abnormalities (Chapter 67). Malignant hypertension is commonly defined as sustained, elevated arterial blood pressure, with diastolic levels of 130 mm Hg or greater and systolic pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg. Abnormal funduscopic findings include papilledema, retinal linear hemorrhages, or extravascular cotton-wool exudates. Hypertensive encephalopathy is classically characterized by rapidly evolving severe hypertension associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, seizures, confusion, stupor, and ultimately coma. Focal neurologic signs are common.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716047004152Hypertensive EmergenciesEduardo Pimenta, ... Suzanne Oparil, in Cardiac Intensive Care (Second Edition), 2010Hypertensive EncephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy is the most difficult neurologic emergency to diagnose and frequently it is a diagnosis of exclusion.17 With better diagnosis and treatment of primary hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy is infrequent. However, prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent progression to hemorrhage. This becomes a particularly difficult issue when hypertensive encephalopathy occurs in previously normotensive persons, as with preeclampsia or “crack” cocaine abuse. Hypertensive encephalopathy is also associated with secondary causes of severe hypertension, such as renal disease, immunosuppressive therapy,34,35 erythropoietin use,36 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.37Ordinarily cerebral blood flow is autoregulated (i.e., cerebral resistance vessels constrict and dilate in response to changes in systemic pressure) to maintain a constant perfusion pressure (Fig. 28-2).17,38-41 In normotensive subjects, perfusion pressure is maintained over a wide range of mean arterial pressure (60 to 120 mm Hg). With chronic hypertension, the mean BP range over which cerebral perfusion is maintained is shifted upward (160 to 180 mm Hg), such that persons with long-standing hypertension can tolerate greater elevations in BP without compromising cerebral perfusion. When elevations in systemic BP exceed the brain's ability to locally autoregulate cerebral perfusion, overperfusion ensues, resulting in cerebral edema, small vessel damage, and microinfarctions. As indicated earlier, breakdown in autoregulation of cerebral perfusion occurs at much lower BP levels in previously normotensive subjects than in persons with chronic hypertension.Hypertensive encephalopathy most commonly develops over a period of several days. The patient usually complains of headache, nausea, visual changes, or focal neurologic symptoms. Physical examination generally reveals disorientation, obtundation, focal neurologic signs, seizures, and retinopathy, including papilledema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizure disorder, encephalitis, and drug overdose.17The drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is nitroprusside (Table 28-6). It should be titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20% or to a DBP of 100 mm Hg within the first hour.17 Particular caution is needed in elderly patients and in those with preexisting hypertension in whom overagressive reduction in BP may be accompanied by worsening of neurologic status and even stroke. Neurologic function should improve with BP reduction. If not, a diagnosis other than hypertensive encephalopathy should be entertained. Labetalol can be used as an alternative to nitroprusside. Agents that suppress central nervous system function, such as β-blockers and central nervous system active agents, and agents that increase cerebral blood flow, such as nicardipine and nitroglycerin, should be avoided.View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978141603773610028XNeurologic Aspects of Systemic Disease Part IIIC. Lamy, ... J.L. Mas, in Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 2014Hypertensive encephalopathyHypertensive encephalopathy requires immediate blood pressure reduction (not necessarily to normal ranges) to prevent or limit target organ damage. As there have been no large clinical trials, treatment of hypertensive encephalopathy is dictated by consensus (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000).Most experts recommend that mean arterial blood pressure should not be lowered by more than 20% during the first hour with a target diastolic blood pressure of 100–110 mmHg (Slama and Modeliar, 2006). If possible, patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and the blood pressure lowered under constant monitoring. Intravenous administration of antihypertensive drugs is generally preferred. Excessive falls in pressure must be avoided, particularly in elderly patients and in those with pre-existing hypertension, because they may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia. Although not evidence-based, the use of anticonvulsants in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy who are having seizures is reasonable (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006).Suitable agents in the management of hypertensive encephalopathy must satisfy a number of criteria: be usable by intravenous injection, have rapid onset of action, and be easily titrated with a short half-life allowing more flexible use. The drugs proposed include nicardipine, urapidil, labetalol,and sodium nitroprusside (Vaughan and Delanty, 2000; Slama and Modeliar, 2006; Varon, 2009). There is insufficient randomized control trials evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity (Perez and Musini, 2008).Oral therapy should be instituted before parenteral agents are discontinued. The management of hypertensive encephalopathy also includes early recognition and withdrawal of exacerbating factors such as immunosuppressive drugs (Hinchey et al., 1996).View chapterPurchase bookRead full chapterURL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702040887001097Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournal of the Neurological SciencesJournalNeurologic ClinicsJournalEmergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaJournalJournal of Clinical NeuroscienceJournalBrowse books and journalsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
